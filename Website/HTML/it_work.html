        <h1>Interview an IT professional</h1>
        <hr>

        <!-- Levian, your job is to use your interview data to answer the follwowing -
            • What kind of work is done by the IT professional?
            • What kinds of people does the IT professional interact with? Are they other IT professionals? 
            ` Clients? Investors? The general public?
            • Where does the IT professional spend most of their time?
            • What aspect of their position is most challenging?
        -->
        <p>
         The professional that our team member, Levian, had interviewed goes by the name of Trent, a man that works for Aftershock and handles the troubleshooting of 
         his customer’s issues, he is a systems administrator. To complete this job, Trent must use many IT skills and general skills. The IT skills that he uses are 
         troubleshooting, which is the main skill he uses, information gathering, which helps Trent solve the multitude of issues he needs to solve daily, communication, 
         which is a skill that he utilises to learn about his daily issues to solve, and documentation, an important skill that needs to be done for every single issue 
         he solves. 
         <br><br>
         His job requires him to interact with and aid his customers, manage computer maintenance and repairs, maintain automation, and deliver solutions to daily 
         issues. To complete all these things, Trent is required to interact with not only customers, but his CEO, COO, and subordinates. He mostly spends his time 
         finding the answers to issues and proving that something works. The future of technology, whether it includes the robotic, machine learning, or even just an 
         iPhone with 8 cameras are some things that will provide Trent with more work, his take on the possibilities can be summed up with the phrase “new and 
         interesting challenges.” 
         <br><br>
         The best part about his job is the recognition he gets when he proves that he can complete his tasks, which he does daily at his workbench, the only place he 
         works. The most challenging factors of the work Trent does have him facing customer expectations, taking pre-emptive action, communicating the issues he’s 
         troubleshooting and finding the answers to an issue he is having trouble with.
         <br><br>
         Overall, Trent has a remarkably busy job with an overfilled schedule, because of this we were not able to extract a lot of necessary information and were 
         stuck with minimal answers such as “Being recognised and proving I can do it.” These types of answers were enough to put this together, barely, however, I 
         want to just note that an in-depth answer is only possible with a satisfactory level of information gathering, something that the interviewer and interviewee 
         lacked.
