            <h2>Robots -</h2>
            <!-- Copy & paste your technology details from the A2 document here -->
            <h3>What Does It Do?</h3>
            <p>
                The Oxford dictionary gives two definitions to robots -
                <br>
                1 - A machine that is made to look like a human and that can do some things that a human 
                can do
                <br>
                2 - A machine that can perform a complicated series of tasks automatically 
                <br><br>
                In the past neither of those were possibilities, but that didn’t stop Hollywood from making 
                the Terminator. Today the field of robotics is in almost every aspect of our lives, and it’s 
                evolving at a rapid pace. In fact, a robot has been created that looks somewhat like a human, 
                this robot, Ameca, is in the process of learning human-like facial expressions. Each of Ameca’s 
                modules/parts run independently, so just the head, or arm would work without any major issues. 
                At this point in time, Ameca can detect people, track their faces, detect objects and react to 
                them. Ameca can even move in a human-like manner. 
                <br><br>
                Other than Ameca, some robots are being used or developed to do jobs that could be considered 
                dirty, boring, or dangerous. Those kinds of jobs include - <br>
                > Manufacturing <br>
                > Assembly <br>
                > Packing <br>
                > Transport <br>
                > Earth / Space Exploration <br> 
                > Surgery <br>
                > Weaponry <br>
                > Lab Research <br>
                > Burger Creation <br>
                Yes, a robot was made to create burgers. Some are even being used as emotional support for 
                the lonely.
                <br><br>
                A few robotic projects of the past include - 
                <br><br>
                2011 Burger Bot - <br>
                A robot that can create a burger in less than 10 seconds, developed by Momentum Machines. 
                It can "slice toppings like tomatoes and pickles immediately before it places the slice 
                onto your burger, giving you the freshest burger possible." It was created as a garage project 
                and gained years of excitement. 
                <br><br>
                Google’s worker robots - <br>
                Google won a patent on March 31st, 2015, to create worker robots with personalities. The 
                personalities are downloadable from the cloud. One robot can download and use many personalities 
                so that it can interact with many different types of people. 
                <br><br>
                UR3 Arm - <br>
                On March 23rd, 2015, Universal Robots, a Denmark-based robotics company revealed the UR3, a 
                robot designed to handle repetitive manual tasks that weigh up to 3kg. It can replace its own 
                parts and can glue, paint, solder, and weld. 
                <br><br>
                Saul Robot - <br>
                In 2014, Xenex created a robot capable of handling the deadly disease Ebola. It does so with 
                powerful pulses of highly electrical ultraviolet rays, these rays weaken the cells of the Ebola 
                virus. This bot was named Saul Robot. 
                <br><br>
                Asus Zenbo - <br>
                This robot was created on March 21st, 2016, and is essentially your tiny, friendly home 
                assistant. It can autonomously roll around, as well as understand your verbal commands to 
                enable it to do tasks. An Asus Zenbo can be used to remember daily tasks, monitor surroundings 
                to detect emergencies, and it can access smart home services. 
                <br><br>
                Some robotic parts currently in the development segment of creation includes the artificial 
                muscles, artificial skin, and the elastic electric cable. 
                <br><br>
                Artificial Muscles - <br>
                The artificial muscles are created with Carbon Nanotubes. These nanotubes are created with 
                double electrode layers that are separated by a chitosan electrolyte layer consisting of an 
                ionic liquid. The response time is 19 milliseconds, thousands of available frequency ranges, 
                large stress generation of a rate of 1080 Megapascals per second, and high mechanical output 
                power density of 244 Watts per kilogram. This means that the artificial muscles have low power 
                consumption, high flexibility, and a very long working life. In the future it’s possible that 
                robots can have reduced size and weight, this would make them much more human-like. 
                <br><br>
                Notes - <br>
                > An electrolyte is a liquid or gel containing ions that are the result of dissociation. <br>
                > Electrodes are an electric conductor used to contact non-metallic parts of a circuit. <br>
                > Chitosan is a sugar that comes from the outer skeleton of crabs, lobsters, and prawns. <br>
                > An ionic liquid is a salt in the liquid state. 
                <br><br>     
                Elastic Electric Cable - <br>
                Rigid cables can limit movement, become jumbled, and their use has a wear ‘n’ tear limit. These 
                issues can be solved with the use of elastic electric cables, a cable developed by Asahi Kasei 
                Fibers, these cables follow specified shapes so that there is a lot less interference with a 
                robot’s movements. In terms of elasticity, the manufacturer compares them to human skin. 
                <br><br>
                Artificial Skin - <br>
                Laval University created the breakthrough technology of tactile artificial skin and is said to 
                majorly advance human-robot cooperation. Factory robots are powerful, unemotional, and do all 
                the tasks told to them, making them a huge threat to factory workers and so to help with this, 
                tactile artificial skin was investigated. The strength and speed of a robot mixed with the 
                dexterity and analytical ability of a human would increase cooperation. The skin used in 
                prototyping is used to interact with the robots, for example, if you push gently on their 
                artificial skin, they’ll know that contact was made and deduce a command to perform. These 
                prototype robots are made to assist the worker and respond to their requests “as if they were 
                an extension of the body of the worker.”
                <br><br>
            </p>
            <h3>What Is The Likely Impact?</h3>
            <p>
                All this robot talk will worry some about the future; “Will robots take over the world?”, “Will 
                they take over our jobs?” These are good questions and two that sci-fi has attempted to give 
                the worst-case scenarios about for years; however, robots have been all around us for a while. 
                They’ve been automated machines and virtual assistants. So, if they were to “take over” it 
                might not actually be that different, unless you’re fond of entry-level or less cognitive jobs, 
                or they hate us. 
                <br><br>
                It is possible that by 2030, 30% of all jobs would be done by robots, but is that a bad thing? 
                That question is dependent on the type of work said robots would be doing, for example, how 
                many small or entry-level jobs would be left by 2030? Will robots take over the high-level and 
                highly skilled jobs? Would they be able to do every job? Could they rebel? If an Arnold 
                Schwarzenegger bot comes back from the future, you’ll know we’re screwed... that hasn’t happened 
                yet, so we should be fine. Maybe. 
                <br><br>
                To answer the questions above, it has been estimated that 20 million jobs will be replaced with 
                robots by 2030, those jobs include, but are not limited to - <br>
                > Customer service executives <br>
                > Bookkeeping/data entry <br>
                > Receptionists <br>
                > Proof reading <br>
                > Manufacturing <br>
                > Pharmaceuticals <br>
                > Retail <br><br>
                There are some jobs that robots cannot do <i>yet</i>, those include the creative, varied, or “human” 
                jobs that an A.I. cannot replicate - <br>
                > Human resources <br>
                > Public Relations <br>
                > Writers <br>
                > Scientists <br>
                > Psychiatrists <br>
                > Graphic Designers <br>
                > Software Developers<br><br>
                There are jobs that a robotic individual can do, and there are some they cannot, and that’s not 
                even going over if people prefer a more “human” touch. So, answering the question “Will robots 
                take over our jobs?” is difficult to answer, however, based on the above evidence, it’s likely 
                that they will not take over every single job. The smaller, entry-level, or less cognitive is 
                going to include the robotic, but then again, some people do prefer a more “human” aspect from 
                shopping at Big W or trying to find a specific tool at Bunnings. Making this a much trickier 
                question to answer, however, it’s a possibility that there will be some smaller-level jobs 
                remaining. It is also possible that new jobs would be created, either to ensure that the robots 
                work at optimal capacity, or to assist people who do prefer the “human” touch. Could be both. 
                <br><br>
            </p>
            <h3>How Will This Affect You?</h3>
            <p>
                Potentially, robots should be able to take many of the more repetitive jobs, as mentioned 
                above. This would affect me or any of my family members, if by 2030 robots do in fact take 
                over 20 million jobs. This would mean I or anyone else would have to learn more creative ways 
                to earn money part-time or casually, however, this doesn’t affect me as much as it would the 
                people reliant on working in retail, data entry, or even cooking (remember burger bot). 
                <br><br>
                Another factor to consider is how the people reliant on the jobs without a university degree 
                would be able to live, the economy doesn’t exactly take robots taking over jobs into 
                consideration and not everyone is skilled in the more “human-specific,” varied, or creative 
                sections of work. We, however, cannot determine exactly how robots will affect our lives and 
                the workforce. 
                <br><br>
                Programming an artificial intelligence with the body and capabilities of a human would be an 
                incredible advancement, it could even lead to new and exciting discoveries about humans, the 
                world around us, and even the universe. This does not answer how robots affect me, however.  
                <br><br>
                If I had a home assistant bot, I wouldn’t have to get up every time I wanted to turn the lights 
                off, I could get a sandwich made for me instead of making one myself, or I’d slowly start making 
                the robot do all the mundane household tasks. Wouldn’t that be nice. With all the free time I'd 
                have, there would be more shows to binge, more movies to watch, and more games to start losing 
                interest in. To put it simply, my life would be easier but dull. Either way, I find the rise of 
                robotics very interesting, so any new development would be exciting to hear about.  
                <br><br>
                In my daily life, there would be quite a lot of changes. For example, I wouldn’t have to serve 
                in any potential wars, “no experience required” jobs would be far harder to get, I could hire 
                burger bot, or, on a much more serious note, there will be a lot less things to do in life. I 
                prefer the feeling of doing things for myself, from baking myself a cake to writing a program, 
                all with as little external help as possible, that’s just who I am. The rise of robotics is 
                likely to create a world where the smaller things in life, the stuff many can count as a waste 
                of time, the acts that I enjoy doing as the feeling of doing it myself, could become obsolete 
                activities and that would make things rather dull. 
                <br><br>
                An existence where I’d get served instead of doing thing myself is one to shudder at, but that 
                does not mean there will be no improvements to my or anyone else’s life. Robots could make 
                interesting co-op players in video games, they could be used as friends for the lonely, 
                dangerous jobs will not have to be done by people, challenge lovers of quite literally anything
                would have their greatest matches against well-developed robots, and mathematicians, scientists, 
                and researchers could all use the robotic to help with their work, to experiment on, to see how 
                far they’ve come, and to better their work. 
                <br><br>
                Robotics is a field that can be described as a coin flip, there is a 50/50 chance that they are 
                an amazing creation, or a plague unleashed upon us, by us. We don’t know what the future will 
                hold and where robots fit into that future, but we do know that our lives will change, of that 
                there is no doubt.

              <h2>Cybersecurity -</h2>
            <h3>What does Cyber Security do?</h3>
           <p>Cyber Security also known as Information Technology Security, ‘refers to the body of technologies,
            processes, and practices designed to protect networks, devices, programs, and data from attack, damage,
            or unauthorized accesses. Cyber Security involves defending computers, servers, mobile devices, electronic systems,
            networks, and data from malicious attacks.
            To know what the role of cyber security is we will look at what some of the things the term security is defending
            us from. The major threat is malicious attacks also known as Malware uses a vulnerability to breach a network when a
            user clicks on a link or email attachment that would unknowingly contain malware, which then would install malicious
            software inside the system. The term “malware” encompasses several types of attacks including Spyware is a type of
            program a hacker would install to collect information about users and their systems, sending the data to a remote user.
            The attacker can then use the information for extortion purposes or download and install other malicious programs from
            the web.
          <br><br>
            Viruses—these infect applications by attaching themselves to the initialization sequence. The virus replicates itself,
            infecting other code in the computer system. Viruses can also attach themselves to executable code or associate
            themselves with a file by creating a virus file with the same name but with a .exe extension, thus creating a decoy
            that carries the virus.
            Worms—these do not attack the host; Worms are self-contained programs that spread across networks and computers.
            Installing through email attachments is the most common way worms are being used, duplicating themselves to every
            contact in the infected computer email list. Their main use is to overload an email server and achieve a shutdown or
            disruption of network, service, or website.
            The term Cyber Security applies in a variety of contexts, and this can be divided into a few categories.
            Network security is the practice of securing a computer network from intruders, whether targeted attackers or
            opportunistic malware.
            Application security Starts from the creation to create security measures to keep software and devices free from threats.
            They create these protocols in security to stop any data breaches.
            Information security works in both storage and transit data by protecting the integrity and privacy of data.
            Operational security includes the processes and decisions for handling and protecting data assets. The permissions users
            have when accessing a network and the procedures that determine how and where data may be stored or shared all fall under
            this.
          <br><br>
            End-user education addresses the most unpredictable cyber-security factor: people. Anyone can introduce a virus to a secure
            system by accident by not following security protocols set into place. Teaching people to delete emails that have suspicious
            attachments, not to use any USB drives that are not known to them, and all other vital security lessons required by the
            company.
            Cyber Security is there to protect people like you or me and even big businesses from attackers(hackers) trying to steal,
            damage, and extort. We live our lives no knowing what is happening in the world with cyber security, but they are trying
            to keep all of us safe as best they can.
            Some of the technologies and developments that make cyber security better. Artificial intelligence and Deep Learning,
            A two-factor authentication system uses 2-3 different parameters to confirm the user’s identity. The three parameters are,
            something they know, are, and have. Add to those additional layers of information and authentication, and that is where AI
            comes into the picture to help with security. Deep learning is being used to analyse data such as logs, transactions, and
            real-time communications to detect threats or unwarranted activities. Behavioural analytics helps detect potential and
            real-time cyber threats by determining patterns in a system and network activities.</p>
         <br><br>
        <h3>What is the impact?</h3>
         <p>If we look at the history of cyber-crimes and see the damage done to people and businesses, we can get an understanding of
           why we need cyber security now more than ever and the impact it will have as we advance with our development of technology.
           The important thing to think about is, that as we advance so do the hackers, so what can we do? We will always have hackers
           no matter what it is that simple, we must be smarter and stay ahead of the game with better ideas and Technology developments
           that make it harder for hackers. As we develop innovative technologies to help with cyber security the hackers will eventually
           get their hands on this, so this could be a potential impact of certain developments for cyber-warfare. This could affect
           countries in many ways, as we have seen in the past with hackers accessing utility grids, banks, and personal information.
           The impact of Cyber Security has and will have on a global scale, would mean more jobs created more education for society
           on cyber-crimes and cyber security, more secure personal information, and banking.
           Some of the changes we will see are more authentication protocols being used across everyday activities like emails, banking,
           connecting to the web, logging not your computer, using your mobile phone, and many more.
           As we look towards the future the impact of artificial intelligence being used more in the cyber security sector could
           impact jobs by making humans redundant in certain aspects of the job, which in turn will create job redundancy in parts
           of the sector. This will open more jobs in other sectors to do with the Artificial Intelligence creation and maintenance
           of computer systems, which even means more computer parts will be needed to build these systems, so the impact is up and
           down.</p>
         <br><br>
        <h3>How will this affect you?</h3>
         <p>I, personally think the effect on me in my daily life from cyber security would be would be helpful as the advancements
            in this field are paving the future of privacy, our information such as personal data like name, address, date of birth,
            contact number, family members details, and so much more, is being leaked and sold off to the highest bidders on the dark
            web, who can use this information and gain access to your accounts and more. That is where cyber security comes into it
            by helping prevent these events like this from happening by advancing skills and teaching society about risks and
            prevention of cyber-attacks.
            This will give opportunities to build knowledge and skills and get a career in the sector of cyber security whether
            the government or private sector has increased over the years and would be good to get a career in this field to help
            others by protecting the against threats like hackers. We all have family members or friends that are not technology
            savvy or do not know if the email stating that they won a prize is some form of malware that will be activated when
            they open it, that’s where cyber security comes into play by helping prevent thing like this with the information and
            training provided to individuals, but it’s not an overnight thing that’s going to happen, it will take time but
            hopefully one day we won’t have to worry about our family or friends opening that email.
            As time goes on, we advance and that means security protocols will become more complex and time-consuming
            to access our data or information but will be a nuisance to a small number of people but a necessary procedure to
            ensure we have the full protection of our data and information.</p>

            <h2>Machine Learning -</h2>
            <!-- Copy & paste your technology details from the A2 document here -->
            <p>
                Machine learning is the method of teaching computers how to learn so they can analyse data to answer questions. To learn, computers need to run tests on themselves thousands or sometimes millions of times. There are different methods of teaching computers to learn which are called models. There are various models for machine learning, but they all fall under two categories, supervised learning, and unsupervised learning. Supervised learning is when a person needs to oversee the machine’s approach. For example, the person will tell the machine the categorize data given to it as either a dog or a cat. In this scenario, the machine would run tests on itself to see if it has categorized the data correctly. Unsupervised learning, on the other hand, is when the machine identifies clusters in the data, and then categorizes them without categories being identified by a human; these categories are known as classes.
            </p>
            <p>
                We can use machine learning to perform a variety of tasks, including but not limited to better artificial intelligence in video games, personalised digital media, and digital personal assistants. In 2016, the greatest go player in the world was defeated by IBM’s Alpha Go. Go is an ancient Chinese game that is known for its extremely high difficulty level. The Alpha Go was designed for tackling the task of mastering the game to demonstrate how far machine learning has progressed. The way it practised Go was by practising against itself millions of times. This project was one of, if not the biggest display of machine learnings power in artificial intelligence within videogames. Personalised digital media is present in streaming services such as Netflix, Spotify, and Apple Music. The algorithms used in these streaming services will choose recommendations for you based on the content you have previously enjoyed, or they can be used to eliminate buffering and low-quality video. Digital personal assistants such as Amazon Alexa and Google Home are only the initial steps towards the age of digital personal assistants. Companies like Amazon and Google are currently financing development for better voice recognition, and greater daily routine machine learning to open the door to the next step in digital assistant development.
            </p>
            <p>
                Due to machine learning, we are likely to have robots that can be our friends, in-home robots for the elderly or disabled, and robots that can take over dangerous jobs very soon. In 2014, a Japanese company revealed a robot that can read emotions, develop its own emotions, and help make humans happy. The robot named “Pepper” went on sale in 2015 and was sold out within a minute. This product is the first step to robot friends becoming a reality. In-home robots for the elderly or disabled may replace carers soon. In-home robots could take care of daily tasks, therefore enabling these people to be independent for as long as possible. So far, we have systems based on infrared cameras to detect when an elderly person falls but, we still have many advancements to make before these in-home robots become a reality. Bomb disposal is a job that is currently fulfilled by robots, they need a human pilot currently but as machine learning evolves, dangerous jobs like bomb disposal will be done by artificially intelligent robots. A job that may be replaced soon is welding. Advancements in machine learning are enabling robots to identify locations to weld. Without machine learning technology, this would not be possible.
            </p>
            <p>
                The history of machine learning dates to the 50s. In the 50s, Arthur Samuel of IBM developed a computer program for playing checkers. His design included a scoring function that attempted to measure the chances of each side winning based on the position of the pieces on the board. Arthur Samuel also created the name “machine learning” in 1952. After Arthur’s invention, people started to develop machine learning-based inventions at a rapid rate. The most notable early inventions in machine learning were the perceptron, the nearest neighbour algorithm, and multilayers.
            </p>
            <p>
                The perceptron was created by Frank Rosenblatt In 1957. The perceptron was a program that was originally planned as a machine. The mark one perceptron was the first neurocomputer, but it had many problems including the inability to recognise visual patterns such as faces. Investors eventually became frustrated by the lack of progress, and the project was eventually abandoned due to a lack of funding.
            </p>
            <p>
                The nearest neighbour algorithm was created by Marcello Pelillo, and it was the beginning of basic pattern recognition. The nearest neighbour algorithm was used for mapping routes and was one of the earliest algorithms used by salespeople. A salesperson would enter a city and the program would visit all the nearest cities until each city had been visited.
            </p>
            <p>
                Multilayers provided the next step within the advancement of neural network research. It was discovered that the perceptron could be much more efficient if it were provided with multiple layers, rather than one layer. Many multilayered neural networks were created after the birth of the perceptron. The use of multilayers led to the creation of two inventions known as feedforward neural networks and backpropagation.
            </p>
            <p>
                Backpropagation was developed in the 1970s. Backpropagation allows a network to adjust its hidden layers. The adjustment of its hidden layers allows the network to adapt to new situations as they occur. The word backpropagation is short for “the backward propagation of errors.” Errors can be processed at the output so they can be distributed back through the network’s layers for learning purposes. Currently, backpropagation is used for deep neural network training.
            </p>
            <p>
                Shortly after backpropagation was invented, machine learning and artificial intelligence took separate paths. Previously, machine learning and artificial intelligence were focused on using knowledge-based approaches rather than algorithms. The machine learning sector was used to train artificial intelligence, but once artificial intelligence and computer science researchers abandoned neural network research, machine learning and artificial intelligence researchers split into two separate fields.
            </p>
            <p>
                After the fields were divided, machine learning researchers and technicians struggled for a decade. The new goal for the machine learning industry was to solve problems in service providing. Machine learning started to direct its focus toward the use of probability theory and statistics. During this challenging time, the machine learning industry continued to work on neural network research and exploded in the 90s due to the rise of the internet. The reason the internet provided exponential growth to the machine learning industry was due to the amazing availability of data, and the ability to share their services with the entire world. During and after the internet boom, there were many notable advancements in machine learning. The most notable of these includes boosting algorithms, speech recognition, and facial recognition.
            </p>
            <p>
                Boosting algorithms are used for reducing bias during supervised learning. The concept of boosting was first introduced in 1990 within a paper by Robert Schapire. Schapire explains that “A set of weak learners can create a single strong learner.” A strong learner is easily classified and parallel with true classification. This development paved the way for many boosting algorithms that machine learning professionals use today including but not limited to AdaBoost, BrownBoost, and LPBoost.
            </p>
            <p>
                Currently, most speech recognition training uses a deep-learning technique known as long short-term memory, which is a neural network model described by Jürgen Schmidhuber and Sepp Hochreiter in 1997. This model can learn tasks that require memory of events that took place much earlier than other speech recognition models could. In 2015, Google adopted long short-term memory into their speech recognition program. After they integrated long short-term memory, they saw a performance jump of 49%.
            </p>
            <p>
                The current facial recognition algorithms stem from the work of competitors from the 2006 “Face Recognition Grand Challenge.” The algorithms that were entered into the challenge were evaluated by a National Institute of Standards and Technology program. They found that the algorithms in the competition were ten times more accurate than facial recognition algorithms from 2002, and they were one-hundred times more accurate than algorithms from 1995. The most incredible part was that the algorithms that were entered into the competition outperformed human identification skills, and they could easily see the difference between identical twins.
            </p>
            <p>
                Machine learning is likely to impact many fields including but not limited to data analysis, artificial intelligence in video games, and robotics. I chose to focus on these fields because each of them will show exponential growth in a range of facets. The field where I see the greatest range of uses is data analysis, I see the greatest entertainment growth in machine learning’s advancements within video games’ AI, and I see the greatest innovation in robotics. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Machine learning’s impact on data analysis will be a faster analysis of data, greater efficiency in data mining, and unbelievably rapid big data analysis. These advancements will change other fields such as business, marketing, finance, and many others. These fields have already received plenty of benefits from machine learning advancements, and the benefits will only grow as machine learning progresses. These advancements will create jobs within the technology sector, and the marketing sector amongst many others. These advancements will also impact people outside the fields I have mentioned. In fact, these advancements will impact everyone in the world.
            </p>
            <p>
                Machine learning’s impact on artificial intelligence in video games will provide a much greater user experience. In the past, many artificially intelligent players (bots) were terrible. Their attempts to defeat or help the player were futile and they would often cause players more harm than good if they were on a players’ team. For instance, in Counter-Strike many players have complained about the bots in the game running into a firefight and dying instantly. The worst part of this is that when your rank climbs, the bots stay at the same level of intelligence. So, if you are in a high rank, the bot will still run into a firefight and die instantly. The only difference is that instantly seems even more instantaneous. With the advancements in machine learning, not only Counter-Strike players, but many other players would also have fewer ‘rage quits,’ improving their gaming experience and mental health. The impact of greater artificial intelligence within videogames would also be beneficial for creating new jobs within the gaming industry.
            </p>
            <p>
                The impact machine learning will provide in the field of robotics is going to be the most momentous change of all. In a future where machine learning has been developed to a great extent for robotics, robots will be able to take over dangerous jobs, do our chores, and take care of us when we are unable to take care of ourselves. Robots taking over our most dangerous jobs will be excellent for preventing many people from having the horrible experience of dying at work. The biggest concern with robots taking over jobs is the impact on entry-level jobs, and jobs that do not require a high degree of cognitive ability. These jobs being replaced will affect the economy, people who desire entry-level or cognitively simple jobs, and people who possess a low IQ.
            </p>
            <p>
                The effects of advancements in machine learning specifically within data analysis will be a mixed bag for not only me, but everyone else as well. The robustness of future video recommendation algorithms will be amazing, but the invasion of privacy that targeted advertising algorithms are sure to commit will be terrible. We have already seen the effects of the targeted advertising algorithms of today breaching privacy. As an example, the algorithm Facebook previously had would target advertisements based on your sexual orientation, religion, and race. These types of algorithms are despised by many people including myself and many of my family and friends. These immoral targeted advertising algorithms are likely to grow in numbers as machine learning in data analysis progresses. The positive impact of machine learning in data analysis specifically in video recommendation algorithms, will impact me in an excellent way because of the wide range of genres I like to watch daily. The current algorithms show me videos from only one or two genres even though I watch more than ten. I am nervous about the effect of machine learning advancements in data analysis, but I am also excited for the positive changes it will bring into the world.
            </p>
            <p>
                Advancements in machine learning will heighten my gaming experience and many of my friends’ experiences. I look forward to the day when bots in video games are indistinguishable from players. I am craving the day when machine learning reduces my and many others’ frustration when it comes to playing alongside bots. The advancements in this field will impact me greater than others because of my love of playing games where bots are significantly included daily. The thought of one day getting to play alongside, or against a bot who is as good, or better than me, is one of the reasons I am so interested in machine learning.
            </p>
            <p>
                My excitement towards advancements in machine learning within the field of robotics is because of the amazing applications it has in helping diverse types of people in numerous ways. For example, machine learning’s development in robotics will allow me to never have to do chores, one of my biggest dreams, but many other people will have much more life-changing experiences with machine learning’s impact in robotics. I am excited for elderly people and disabled people, not having a human carer would relieve some stress off them and is sure to enhance their quality of life. I look forward to seeing fewer people die at work because I can only imagine how terrible that would be. I also look forward to seeing people who feel alone with a robot friend to keep them company, even if it is unorthodox. My friends and I will benefit from most of the advancements but, many of my friends’ jobs may become redundant soon. The effect of these machine learning advancements in robotics will be good for many people, but the people who it will cause harm, will have a terrible time. The impact of these advancements closing in on jobs will have minimal effect on me once I get a job in the technology industry, but I fear for my friends and the many others who will be negatively affected by these advancements. I believe that there will be a solution to this problem soon, hopefully before robots start to eat larger chunks of entry-level jobs and cognitively simple jobs. I have hope that the advancements in machine learning within the field of robotics will serve people, more than it tears them down.
            </p>
            <p>
                In conclusion, machine learning is an interesting field that has many real-world applications. Teaching computers to learn is one of the greatest developments in the field of IT, and the benefits of this will be even greater soon. Machine learning advancements may cause some trouble, but overall, they will benefit humanity in many amazing facets. I have delved into only three of these facets, but there are many more fields that have benefitted, and will continue to benefit from the wonderful field that is machine learning.

            <h2>Autonomous Driving -</h2>
            <!-- Copy & paste your technology details from the A2 document here -->
        <h3>What Does it do?</h3>

            In the simplest terms, autonomous driving is the ability of a car or any form of machine to 
            navigate itself from a start point to a predetermined destination without user or driver 
            intervention or assistance. There are multiple real-world examples today of semi-autonomous 
            driving; this is defined by the car's ability to perform a basic level of driving function 
            without intervention by the user. Some examples of these technologies include autonomous brake
            assistance, where the vehicle will use sensor data to brake the car when it has predicted a 
            collision is imamate. Or active lane-keeping, where sensors will collect data from the road and 
            actively assist the driver keep the car's position between the road lines.  
            <br><br>
            While these technologies and more do not constitute autonomous driving, they are becoming commonplace 
            in most new cars. They indicate the first step towards full autonomous vehicle on the road. Many 
            companies have implemented features that will intervene in a safety crisis and take control of the 
            vehicle. Still, it is essential to mention that there are significant barriers to the full automation 
            of vehicles that most car companies have yet to encounter.  
            <br><br>
            It would be hard to talk about autonomous driving technologies without mentioning Tesla. Where most 
            companies have focused on driver assistance rather than automation, Tesla has moved quickly into the 
            space of autonomous driving, having released multiple versions of their autonomous driving software, 
            Autopilot. As it stands today, autopilot has not reached a level where it could be considered entirely 
            autonomous and still requires a driver to be conscious and have a hand on the wheel when autopilot is 
            operating, primarily due to regulation and the fact that this software is still considered a beta or in 
            development. From all available examples of current technologies, we can create an image that should 
            closely approximate what an autonomous vehicle of the future will look like, both the hardware and 
            software. 
            <br><br>
            Starting with the hardware, autonomous vehicles will require an extensive array of sensors, including 
            radar, Lidar and cameras, among others. The primary use of these sensors is to provide the car with eyes, 
            allowing it to perceive its surroundings. Today, some, if not most, cars are fitted with a reverse camera 
            that provides a great example of how these sensors would operate. The main difference is the interpretation 
            of the data assessed by a computer rather than a human operator. This brings us to the computer hardware, which 
            is not new to cars as most have been fitted with some form of computer for many years. Still, nothing is close 
            to processing the billions of calculations per second required for total autonomous driving. The more sensors 
            attached to the car, the more necessary the computer is to process and interpret all the data collected by the 
            connected sensors. The requirements assumed for processing the amount of data that the sensors will be taking 
            in and proving response in the form of velocity adjustment have already changed in the last decade compared 
            to what was first conceptualised. As the first responder, Tesla suggested that their earliest cars would be 
            capable of full self-driving. But after updating their in-car computers to custom-designed silicon in 2018, 
            they adjusted expectations for the ability of the earlier models to be capable of full self-driving. The new 
            chips provided a remarkable increase in processing power from the older models said to be needed to implement 
            full self-driving properly. 
            <br><br>
            What makes a good driver? The best car will only be as good as the driver behind the wheel. Still, when it comes 
            to autonomous driving, we are not talking about any physical entity behind the wheel but a software program 
            interpreting sensor data and making decisions based on the data. Multiple companies are collecting data to teach 
            these programs how to drive. This data can come in many forms, including real drivers and maps. There have already 
            been multiple examples of retrofitted autonomous cars having minor accidents on roads; these cars are training 
            and collecting various data points for companies to research. Tesla has openly admitted to using acquiring driver 
            data from their customers to help prepare their autopilot software.  
            <br><br>
            While autonomous driving, as outlined above, is focused on the consumer car market, in its very essence, a machine 
            can be able to control itself between two points while being able to adjust and overcome any number of issues that 
            could arise during the journey as any physical driver would. This technology could be applied to any machine that a 
            person usually operates. 
            <br><br>
            <h3>What is the likely Impact?</h3>
            The impact of autonomous driving could be similar to the mobile computing revolution when you consider the total 
            effect on our day to day lives. So much of our modern world requires transport; it is how we commute, receive and send. 
            Imagine if you could apply the same increase in productivity that email has had over your regular postal service to 
            every aspect of transport. 
            <br><br>
            A fully functioning autonomous driver would be able to pilot a vehicle at higher speeds than any human operator 
            while maintaining safety standards beyond that same human's ability. The increase in speed alone would revolutionise 
            a consumer-driven world that is speed focused. To use a minor example, most people will have utilised a click and collect 
            feature from a supermarket to do a grocery shop or even delivery at one point during the recent pandemic. Still, we 
            see supermarket employees walking the isles collecting goods for customers; with autonomous driving technologies, most 
            touchpoints for this basic process could be automated and robotised. An autonomous vehicle could walk the isles and 
            collect the goods before dispensing them at the drop off point for delivery. The next autonomous vehicle receives the 
            goods and drops them off to the consumer, with the entire process taking potentially less than 60min from order to 
            delivery. 
            <br><br>
            While this example illustrates a likely positive outcome of autonomous driving technologies, it is also essential to 
            consider some downsides. Employment within the transportation industry is a notable example of a potential negative 
            impact of this emerging technology. Replacing drivers as a general term could lead to a mass of unemployed, relatively 
            low skilled workers. While some could potentially be retrained to continue the development of autonomous vehicles, 
            most would be left without a source of income. Broadly the field of automation has many worried about this outcome. 
            As income inequality already runs rampant in our economy, these technologies serve only to continue to grow the 
            wealth of the smallest number of individuals, who continue to devalue this sort of work and the employees who do it.  
            <br><br>
            The overall impact on the world as we know it will be immense; for better or worse, we will have to wait and see. 
            Without any doubt, technologies like autonomous driving have the potential to impact the world for the better, 
            improving the greater good. Still, as with most giant leaps forward in technology, it will be equally essential to 
            drive the change responsibly. 
            <br><br>
            <h3>How will this affect you?</h3>
            As seen through a personal lens, autonomous driving will be different for every individual, but my day-to-day life 
            will change immensely for myself, like many others. I travel in one form or another every day. I often drive myself 
            or someone else to work or a meeting; this takes hours every day. This alone will leave me with potentially 8-16 hours 
            every week that would otherwise be occupied with driving for other activities.  
            <br><br>
            This is no small amount of time to be gifted with; the question becomes, what do you do with your newfound wealth of 
            spare hours. Assuming that at the same time, most of the world's transport has become automated in one way or another, 
            the time savings within personal vehicles are only beginning. Still, as we accumulate more spare time, leading towards 
            a world of leisure and pleasure in the best-case scenario, we should also consider how most time-saving technologies 
            implemented over the last few decades have impacted our lives.  
            <br><br>
            Most technologies designed to save human time have had their fruits consumed by capitalism. While productivity has 
            increased, free time has decreased as corporations milk us for each spare minute of our time through work and play. 
            Will we be required to work through our commute in this new autonomous world? Every day, two extra hours sounds 
            like a tempting treat for any company with an employee who thought they might read a book or play a game while 
            their car drove them to work.  
            <br><br>
            As a car owner, selecting a vehicle based on individual needs and wants provides an exciting point about purchasing 
            an autonomous vehicle. Would one even need to own such a vehicle? While today so much of a car purchase is based on 
            the driver, what would this same purchase look like if you would never drive it? You would be buying a comfortable 
            chair. This assumes that we, or more correctly, car companies, have not found a new way to differentiate themselves 
            in the market, such as their autonomous driving software quality. 
            <br><br>
            Autonomous driving will impact our lives in many fundamental ways, such as changing the need for milestones such as 
            getting a driver's licence and many more intriguing ways that cannot be perceived yet. Like most changes of this magnitude, 
            we will be responsible for its impact on us. The hope is that we learn to utilise the tools we create to further the human 
            condition for the better rather than allowing ourselves to become slaves to the machines that were meant to improve our lives.
