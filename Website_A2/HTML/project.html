        <!-- Jay, it's your job to create then add the group's project details -->
        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p>
            A video game including aliens, weapons, power-ups, customisation, a sci-fi theme, and a fantastic story. Our project idea can be summed up in a sentence, but it is worth much more than that. Our video game will be a beautiful amalgamation of three integral aspects, story, challenge, and strategy. Our video game will be different from the norm because we feel the need to explore beyond what these aspects currently are in modern video games to enhance the user experience for these three types of players.
        </p>
        <p>
            The story will tell a deeply interesting well-paced and action-packed story about the tragic takeover of the international space station in 2222. One lone member of the crew must defeat all the attackers, solo, alone. Who are these attackers you may ask, an alliance of deadly alien races each with unique sets of skills and a combat-hardened commander.
        </p>
        <p>
            As the user defeats the hordes of aliens, they gain weapons, equipment, and power-ups. Each of these will contain unique ways to defeat aliens. There will be four weapons, each providing both advantages and disadvantages. There will be various sets of equipment that will aid the player when they are in a pinch. There will also be unique power-ups that will be useful in two ways. Some will provide the user with unique abilities for a fleeting period, and some will get them out of tough situations quickly and efficiently. All of these will be available in each game mode.
        </p>
        <p>
            There will be two game modes in the game which will be the story mode and the “swarm mode.” The story mode will have something for players who love a well-written story, a tough challenge, and strategic elements, while the swarm mode will have something for players who prefer a round-based experience over a story-based experience.
        </p>
        <p>
            The challenging aspects of the game will primarily be in the form of difficulty settings. There will be four difficulty settings: easy, normal, hard, and extreme. The other aspect of the challenging side will be the variation of the fighting styles that each alien will use. The fighting styles will fall under two archetypes: offensive, and defensive. This feature will cater to players who love challenge and strategy. The combination of the features in the gameplay and the story will provide players with the versatile experience they crave so dearly in the current gaming market.
        </p>
        <h3>Motivation</h3>
        <p>
            Giving users the ability to play how they want is one of the core aspects of our project’s motivation. Versatility in gameplay is a core concept that too many video games lack. In contrast, our project will have different playstyles incorporated into the gameplay to allow the use of either a guns-blazing style or a strategic style. Users will also love the ability to switch between two unique modes so they can have their preferred experience.
        </p>
        <p>
            Fans of challenging aspects in video games will love the “swarm mode. Swarm mode is a round-based mode that will provide a competitive aspect stemming from users boasting about achieving high rounds. Fans of challenging features within video games will also love many of the elements that are within the story mode.
        </p>
        <p>
            Story and strategy fans will love the story mode because it will provide aspects that both fans will love. The aspects that story mode will provide to story fans are an action-packed storyline, well-paced story, engaging characters, and a final twist that is sure to get users excited to play through the story again. The aspects of story mode which will cater to strategy fans specifically are the weapon variation, and the strategic use of power-ups. The strategy fans will also love that each type of alien has different strengths and weaknesses, making each encounter require a unique approach.
        </p>
        <p>
            We decided to centre our approach around the three archetypes previously mentioned because we found that the aspects of video games that these three archetypes love are severely lacking in the modern era of gaming. In an article published by Pluralsight in 2014, they outlined four key areas that a game needs to have. These key areas are gameplay, story, challenge, and game art.
        </p>
        <p>
            Gameplay innovation is one of the key aspects that has not been included within recent titles. The gameplay is often recycled from a previous title with minor changes, so we decided that we need to innovate for the players. We need an exceptional story for this project because many titles in the modern era do not have a story, or they have a poorly written story. That is why we decided to create a story fan archetype to cater to. We also need challenge within our game, because the challenge in modern video games is laughable for players who love to use their skill or brain within a video game. The game art aspect of the core four was the one that we did not assign to our archetypes because it is the most general of the four. Everyone loves beautiful game art, but the three archetypes that we focused on have more specific needs and are constantly underappreciated by game developers and designers. The three archetypes that we chose: story fan, challenge fan, and strategy fan, are the types of players that our project will give preferential treatment to, rather than the usual suspects that game developers and designers prioritise. This project is for the people who have been underdogs and want nothing more than to play a game that cares about them.
        </p>

        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>
            Our project’s gameplay is our number one priority. We will achieve excellent gameplay through prioritising it over the story and adding many of the features that we have ideated through the design process. Our brilliant gameplay will be driven by strategic and challenging elements in a cohesive manner. This will provide the challenge fan and strategy fan archetypes with the features that they desire within video games.
        </p>
        <p>
            The challenge fans will love our prized possession, the swarm mode. The swarm mode will be a round-based mode that increases the difficulty for each wave the player defeats. The swarm mode will provide challenge fans with a fun mode that will give them a reason to push to the next round. They will love bragging about their highest round with their friends, or on social media. This is because of the insane level of difficulty that comes with the incredibly high rounds.
        </p>
        <p>
            Speaking of difficulty, people who love challenge will adore the difficulty system within our game. We will have four difficulty levels: easy, normal, hard, and extreme. These difficulty levels will impact the players health, the speed of the enemies, and the rarity of power-ups and weapons. This will be an excellent feature that challenge players are sure to enjoy.
        </p>
        <p>
            Another feature of the game that players who desire a challenging experience will enjoy are the different pieces of equipment. They will love the equipment in the game because each will give the player a unique ability. For example, the invisibility cloak will give players the ability to become invisible to enemies for a brief period. The equipment will be in the players inventory throughout the game and the abilities will recharge as the player defeats aliens. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The aliens in the game will provide enjoyment to both challenge fans and strategy fans alike. The specific feature of the aliens that they will enjoy most of all will be the variation of their combat. One type of alien may use their shield to take a larger amount of hits, while another alien may use their powerful attacks to destroy the player in a few hits. Each of the aliens will have a unique strength and unique weakness, therefore making each of them a unique threat to the player. This will force players to always be on their toes and use their brain to ideate strategies to defeat each unique type of alien. The aliens within the game will be broken up into two categories, offensive and defensive.
        </p>
        <p>
            The offensive aliens will be referred to as the bomber, the sniper, and the mosquito. The bomber will attack the player by running at the player and blowing itself up. The bomber is the ultimate alien to keep the player on their toes. If the player does not kill the sniper within a few seconds after it enters the room, it will open fire causing the player extremely high points of damage. This alien will force the player to always watch the entrances closely. The mosquito will attack the player by rushing at them and impaling them if they get too close. This alien will force the player to always stay on the move so that they can kill them before they get too close.
        </p>
        <p>
            The defensive aliens will have lower damage outputs than offensive aliens, but they will have much higher health than them. The defensive aliens will be referred to as the shield, the turret, and the armoured wing. The shield will move slowly towards the player and attack them with their shield if they get close enough. If the player destroys its shield, the shield will rush at the player in a fit of rage with its razor-sharp arms drawn. The shield will be perfect for forcing the player to keep their fire trained on it because if they do not, they will be the victim of vicious attacks. The turret will be an alien carrying a turret that can be deployed to fire at the player with its high fire rate and damage output. The downside of the turret is that once it’s turret is deployed, it will not be able to move unless it stops firing. This alien will be brilliant at always keeping the player aware of their position. The armoured wing will be an alien that shoots concentrated energy at the player while it slowly flies closer to them. As the armoured wing moves closer, its damage increases dramatically. The armoured wing will make certain that the player destroys them quickly. If the player does not, the player is sure to die at a rapid rate.
        </p>
        <p>
            Strategy fans will also be ecstatic about the way that power-ups need to be used within the game. Power-ups will need to be used efficiently because they will become rarer as the game progresses, and as the difficulty level increases. The way that users can use these power-ups efficiently is by storing them in their inventory until they need them. However, this does not come without challenges; this is because the player can only store one power-up at a time.
        </p>
        <p>
            The power-ups will include but will not be limited to double damage, adrenaline, and pest control. The double damage power-up is self-explanatory. While this power-up is active, it will deal double weapon damage to the enemies. This power-up will be extremely useful during high rounds of swarm mode, and when enemies are overwhelming the player during the story. The adrenaline power-up will give the player unlimited health for a brief period, this will save the player in various situations where they are about to die. The pest control power-up will help the player by killing all the enemies that are currently in the room. This will help players in similar situations to the adrenaline power-up, but it will provide a greater use when the player does not have a good weapon to fend off the horde quickly and efficiently.
        </p>
        <p>
            Another tool to fight the aliens that strategy fans will adore are the four unique weapons. These weapons will be the pistol, the shotgun, the rifle, and the sub-machine gun. Strategy fans will love these weapons because they each provide unique advantages and disadvantages. The pistol will have the advantages of a great damage output at long range and being the weapon that you spawn into the game with. The disadvantages of the pistol will include its low damage per second and its ineffective damage output against multiple attackers. With these advantages and disadvantages taken into consideration, it will be best for the players to find a new weapon as soon as possible as the hordes will only grow in mass. The shotgun will be excellent at defeating hordes of enemies. This is because of its unique advantages of bullet-spread and high damage output at close range. The disadvantages of the shotgun will be its poor range and its slow fire-rate. The shotgun will be the most useful tool to the player when they are dealing with enemies that are overwhelming them, but they will need to aim well because of its range. The bullet-spread will help the player if they miss their shots, but the further the bullet spreads, the less damage it will do to the enemies. The rifle on the contrary, will be marvellous at defeating enemies at medium to long range but will be less effective at close range. With its advantages and disadvantage considered, the rifle will be a great weapon for most situations, but the lack of close-range prowess will be an issue when the player is surrounded by enemies. The sub-machine gun will be an amalgamation of the shotgun and the rifle. Its key advantages will be its close-range ability and its superior fire rate to the rifle. The disadvantages of the sub-machine gun will be its inability to do considerable damage at longer ranges and its lack of bullet-spread that the shotgun provides. The sub-machine gun will be a brilliant all-round weapon for defeating the hordes, but its disadvantages are issues that the player will need to take into consideration when they are utilising the weapon.
        </p>
        <p>
            Strategy fans will also love that they must find equipment by using their key cards wisely. Key cards are items that will be dropped by enemies and can be used to unlock doors. The player will be hinted to the location of equipment with riddles from notes on the walls. If the player uses the key card on the wrong door, their key card will disappear, and they will gain nothing but shattered dreams. On the contrary, if the player finds the correct door, they will be granted with an exceptional piece of equipment that will aid their fight throughout the rest of the game. People who desire a fantastic story will also love key cards. This is because the key cards dropped from the aliens will provide a hint to the final twist of the story. The key cards will not be the only hint to the final twist, there will also be many other hints across the map that story fans will adore looking back on once they complete the story.
        <p>
            Players will love the story because of the engaging characters, great pacing, and the extraordinary final twist. The story will be brief, but impactful. The brief nature of the narrative will not be its downfall, on the contrary, it will be one of its greatest strengths. The narrative being developed in this way will provide users with a quality story, rather than a long story. It is important to note that the story will not be our priority. Gameplay will be the main concern for this project.
        </p>
        <h3>Tools, Tech, and Skills</h3>
        <p>
            For this project to become a reality, we need to utilise Pygame. Pygame is an open-source set of modules for Python. This set of modules is a great tool for creating video games using the Python programming language. Pygame will allow us to create this game with ease when compared to building a game from the ground-up in Python. We will be utilising freecodecamp.org’s two-hour Pygame tutorial to learn Pygame for this project. Four out of our five team members are in the introduction to programming course, so it made sense to create a game based on Python because it is the programming language that each of us are the most comfortable with. This will certainly help us when learning Pygame and, it should make our development process exponentially faster than if we had no skill in programming whatsoever. Another beautiful thing about using Pygame to develop our project, is it happens to be fantastic for developing games with low hardware requirements.
        </p>
        <p>
            Because accessibility is a key factor within our game, we are going to have minimal hardware requirements. This will allow players with any computer created after 2010 to play the game and have an excellent time while doing so. The other hardware requirements will be even more accessible, a mouse and a keyboard. Accessibility is a key area of focus because we want to make sure that all story fans, challenge fans, and strategy fans can play this innovative game.
        </p>
        <p>
            The main feature in the game that will not be innovative but will still provide value is the pixel art style. This style does provide many benefits even though it is not innovative. These benefits include nostalgia, simplicity, and suitability. The nostalgic factor to this art style will be beneficial to this project because it will draw players from the indie community and the retro community. The simplicity will be perfect for this project because it will cater to our deadline, Pygame, and our accessibility requirements. Our deadline being so soon makes a simplistic art style a much better art style than a complex 3D art style. Pygame works much better with a simplistic art style than a 3D art style as well. Pixel art is also great for its ability to make a game run beautifully on older computers, making the accessibility requirements easy to reach. Pixel art also caters to the skills of two of our team members. Adam will be leading the game art section of our team with his desire for creating artwork for the game, and his passion is also coupled with his amazing skills to create pixel art. Levian will be the secondary game art specialist, he has a passion for art and has also worked with pixel art previously. If any of the other team members who do not have pixel art skills want to help on the game art sector, there is a pixel art crash course on YouTube which has a runtime of only twenty minutes making it a viable option for not only Adam and Levian, but the rest of the team too.
        </p>
        <p>
            The story will be an amalgamation of all our team members’ ideas. The story is not our number one priority, but we can manage it because the story will be compact. We also have an excellent system for managing it, because we have a set of predefined roles that Jay has delegated. The roles Jay specified are separated into primary and secondary roles. Daryl will be the primary source of story creation while everyone else will be the secondary source.
        </p>
        <p>
            Expanding upon the roles, Jay will be the primary developer of backend code, Levian will be the primary source of frontend code, James will be the primary creator of the game design aspects, and Adam will be the primary artist for the game art. The secondary roles for each member of the team will have Jay helping James on game design, Levian aiding Adam with game art, James aiding Levian with frontend development, Adam helping Jay on backend development, and Daryl spearheading the sound design. The clear segregation of these roles will help us achieve the completion of the gameplay and story, therefore increasing the odds of a successful outcome.
        </p>
        <h3>Outcome</h3>
        <p>
            If this project is successful, it will provide not only the story fans, strategy fans, and challenge fans with a fantastic game, but also fans of sci-fi, dungeon crawlers, and indie games. If this project is successful, it would solve the issues that plague each of our key archetypes in the current generation of gaming. It would solve the issue of bland, predictable storytelling, it would solve the issue of brain power not being utilised to play most video games, and it would solve the boredom of beating a video game without your heart racing. This project is amazing because its impact would not be limited to the joy of gamers. This project would impact the gaming industry by highlighting that the elements of our motivation are some of the most integral parts of video games. A fantastic story, a brilliant use of strategic elements, and the ability to have a deeply challenging experience are some of the most underutilised elements within today's titles, and if this game were successful, it would be sure to make the giants of the gaming industry think twice about including these overlooked elements within their video games. To summarise what would happen if this project were successful, it would have a fantastic impact on gamers and the entire gaming industry.
