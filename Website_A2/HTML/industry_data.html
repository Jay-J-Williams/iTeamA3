        <h1>Burning Glass</h1>
        <hr>

        ITeam is a group full of intelligent people deadset on accomplishing their goals and aiming to be 
        amazing in their respective fields of IT. All our members are looking to excel in the software side of 
        information technology; Each field requires the knowledge of, at the very least, some programming 
        languages such as Java, Python, C#, HTML, CSS, or JavaScript, and some generic skills such as 
        communication, collaboration, problem solving, and writing. All these mentioned skills, and more are 
        necessary to succeed in everyone's field. 
        <br><br>
        Jay, iTeam’s main organiser, is looking to become a software engineer, a field that is full of logic, 
        creativity, problem solving, and programming all of which appeal to him. James is hoping to become a 
        machine learning engineer, a career that requires the creativity, abstract thinking, and the ability to 
        deal with repetitive and dull tasks that James excels in. Daryl’s field sees him designing the parts of 
        an application, website, game, etc. Specifically, the areas that the user would deal with, it includes 
        fonts, colours that work well together, perfect placements, and ensuring all works properly. Levian is 
        looking to become a generalist programmer, a role that can very easily be described as an all-rounder, 
        to perfectly succeed within the role Levian will have to learn the languages of both front and back end, 
        like HTML, Java, JavaScript, Python, etc. Adam is hoping to become a software developer and is looking 
        to utilise his skills to create whatever program his customers will be looking for. 
        <br><br>
        Below, every one of us have written about our ideal job, used the burning glass data to figure out what 
        is necessary for our roles and what is not, and we’ve all concluded with whether our ideal job has been
        changed.

            <h2>Software Development</h2>
            <p>
                A software developer/programmer develops code for just about anything, from a simple calculator to 
                a full-blown business organisation/management system. Code can be and is used for video games, 
                business management, website interactions, social media, mathematics, robots, and so much more. 
                Because of this, I want to be a developer so that I can learn to create fun, helpful, medical, or 
                robotic programs. 
                <br><br>
                An important question to consider, however, is the difference between a developer and an engineer. 
                Their jobs are very similar, and the coding languages they use are the same. A developer creates, 
                modifies, and debugs their code as well as makes them specific for their customer. An engineer has 
                most of those same roles with the additions of analytics, scaling, testing, and a lot more 
                communication. This makes an engineer’s work, ever so slightly, a more complex job than that of a 
                developer. 
                <br><br>
                Using the 2018 Burning Glass data, in IT job titles, “developer” is split into the coding/computer 
                languages used (e.g., Python developer), as well as front-end and back-end developers (e.g., CSS 
                (front), HTML (back)). The developer-based rankings are as follows - <br>
                > Net Developer | 3rd <br>
                > Front End Developer | 6th <br>
                > Java Developer | 7th <br>
                > Senior Net Developer | 12th <br>
                > Senior Java Developer | 13th <br>
                > Web Developer | 15th <br>
                > Full Stack Developer | 17th <br><br>
                The software developer skills, using the Burning Glass data, are about the coding/computer languages 
                used. The rankings are as follows - <br>
                > SQL | 1st <br>
                > JavaScript | 2nd <br>
                > Java | 3rd <br>
                > SAP | 6th <br>
                > Microsoft C# | 12th <br>
                > NET Programming | 16th <br>
                > Oracle | 19th <br>
                > Git | 21st <br>
                > Python | 22nd <br><br>
                The generic skillset is mainly about the type of things anyone can learn to do (e.g., communication). 
                The top rankings that apply to software development include - <br>
                > Communication | 1st (Landslide) <br>
                > Problem Solving | 2nd <br>
                > Organisation | 3rd <br>
                > Writing | 4th <br>
                > Collaboration | 5th <br> 
                > Planning | 7th <br> 
                > Detail Oriented | 8th <br> 
                > Creativity | 9th <br> 
                > Time Management | 12th <br><br> 
                Each of these skills are very important and if used correctly, can shape a developer’s career from 
                an average developer to a well-known pro. The importance of these skills for a developer are 
                dependent on whether they work by themself or within a team, however, each skill is important in 
                some form or another. <br><br>
                Communication - <br>
                Communication skills are important because they allow developers to understand what a customer 
                would want to be created, or it would help them work well within a team, or properly discuss issues 
                within a system, the code, or just about anything else. Developers aren’t the only field to require 
                communication, and it doesn’t stop at the IT industry either. Just about every job is reliant on 
                some form of Commnication, whether it’s discussing work related issues, making well written emails, 
                or even just talking to people. 
                <br><br>
                Problem Solving - <br>
                Problem-solving is an important skill to develop, preferably early on, because not one good program 
                is ever written without at least some errors. Being able to identify and solve code-related issues 
                would show off the true skills of a developer. 
                <br><br>
                Organisation - <br>
                Organisation code and directories are great skills, and ones that I like, coincidentally those 2 
                skills are required for any good developer. This is because other developers within a team, or a 
                tester just looking through will need to understand what your code says to properly, and effectively 
                continue their work. 
                <br><br>
                Writing - <br>
                When coding, the developer writes using two things, the first is a computer-understood syntax 
                (e.g., Python) and the second is utilising a human-understood syntax (e.g., English). This means 
                that being able to effectively write can be the difference between a good program and an amazing 
                one, no matter what it’s for. 
                <br><br>
                Collaboration - <br>
                A small program can be developed by one person, and with enough time, so can a medium-sized project 
                however, one person cannot work on and create a large/gigantic project full of code, designs, 
                databases, music, or even artificial intelligence. A team is required to really bring a gigantic 
                project to life, and unless the developer is unable to collaborate with others, it would just be a 
                waste of time having them on board. 
                <br><br>
                Planning - <br>
                Planning is an important skill because no program is exactly the same, effectively planning which 
                language, modules, and even way in which the code will be written, will make whatever program a 
                developer creates far better. 
                <br><br>
                Detail Oriented - <br>
                Being detail oriented is yet another skill that could be classified as important, even necessary. 
                A developer being detail oriented would have their program properly indented, filled with enough 
                error exceptions to keep the code working without adding too much/little, and code containing all 
                the necessary detail that is required of it without messing up the program. Orientation to detail 
                is an important skill, and one that is required to help the program work to its highest standard.
                <br><br>  
                Creativity - <br>
                Creativity can go hand in hand with planning, a developer will need to plan how they will build the 
                program, but just how good of a program it will be is dependent on how they decide to write the 
                code, the positions of the try/catch they use, and where they decide to put everything. Besides 
                layout, sometimes a creative solution would be the answer to a bug, or an annoying issue.  
                <br><br>
                Time Management - <br>
                When making a program, there is usually a deadline that the customer would want it by and being 
                able to split their work up to fit that deadline is a very necessary skill to ensure that the 
                customer ends up satisfied. 
                <br><br>
                As for the technical and general skills that a developer does not have, these are the top 3 for 
                each, respectively - <br>
                > Project Management | 5th <br>
                > Business Management | 7th   <br>
                > Business Analysis | 9th  <br>
                > Troubleshooting | 6th  <br>
                > Research | 10th <br>
                > Leadership | 11th <br>
                Having each of these skills would be beneficial for a developer, there is no denying that, however, 
                they are not required. <br><br>
                Project Management - <br>
                This skill would be amazing for a project manager, in fact, it’s required, but a developer, 
                unless special circumstances intervened, would not be managing the project that they work on 
                in a team. So, while it would be a great way to take a break from coding and do something else 
                with their life, it isn’t an essential skill for a developer. 
                <br><br>  
                Business Management - <br>
                Managing a business and managing a project are two separate things, their only thing in common 
                is that someone is managing something however, the reasons a developer would not manage a 
                project is very similar to the reasons they would not manage a business. While it is very 
                unlikely, one reason they might is if the business was a software company, and the manager had 
                the time to do more than their managerial duties. This isn’t to say that a developer cannot 
                become a manager, but their path of work would have to take quite a turn for it to become both 
                a reality and effective. 
                <br><br>  
                Business Analysis - <br>
                “Business analysis is a professional discipline of identifying business needs and determining 
                solutions to business problems.” This skill, while very helpful to a business manager, does, 
                if not nothing then very little to a developer. This is because a developer’s work is done by 
                writing the program a company will use, and that program’s specifications would be provided by 
                the company. The skill has nothing to do with the job. 
                <br><br>  
                Troubleshooting - <br>
                Troubleshooting is defined as ‘analysing and solving serious problems for a company or other 
                organisation”. The most of analysing and solving problems that a developer would be doing is 
                debugging a program, and that is nowhere near the scale of analysis and reparation that a 
                trouble shooter would be doing. This difference is why troubleshooting is not essential for a 
                developer. 
                <br><br>  
                Research - <br>
                When a developer is hired, they are expected to know the language, its modules, and how to best 
                use it without having to google it. This reason is why research is a skill that a developer does 
                not need, in fact it’s one that they shouldn’t use entirely, at the very least, during work. 
                <br><br>  
                Leadership - <br>
                The job of a developer is primarily to write the code of a program that the company or 
                individual(s) hired them to create, sometimes it would include being able to code through the 
                frontend instead of just the backend of the program in creation. There is nothing in this job 
                that points towards being a leader, and as such leadership is a skill sold separately. 
                <br><br>  
                Unlike an engineer, a developer’s jobs are split into the languages that they use, and this 
                makes finding an exact placement very hard, however as the first list mentioned above a net 
                developer is placed in third, a frontend developer is placed in sixth, and a java developer is 
                placed in seventh. These three are not the only factions of software development, but net, 
                frontend, and java are clearly the most in-demand, at least when looking through Burning Glass’ 
                top IT occupations of 2018. 
                <br><br>  
                According to the “Skills Priority List” (official government document) it is very clearly that 
                software development is a job with a very strong continuation into the future and being a 
                strongly continued job means that its very necessary. The usual job experience required of a 
                developer is, at a minimum, 2 to 3 years for an excellent, well-paying job however, while 
                unlikely, there are some companies willing to hire those with less than the usual amount of 
                experience. 
                <br><br>  
                Personally, after taking in all this information, I see no reason to change my desired field, 
                I still want the kind of job where I can create some amazing things to help people, and myself. 
                Like all paths, there are hardships to overcome, and software development’s set include the 
                frustration of code issues/bugs, small, or extremely small deadlines, vague program requirements, 
                possible team issues, and last-minute issues. There is no doubt I have where any of these 
                issues are strong enough to make me quit the field, besides, the modern world runs on code, 
                and this means that my preferred field is extremely unlikely to end in redundancy.

         <h2>Front End Developer (junior)</h2>
            <p>
              Front-end web development uses coding such as HTML, CSS and JavaScript to produce the front end for a website
              or Web Application, once done the user can interact with the website or web application. The challenge associated
              with front end development is that there is constant change in the tools and techniques required to create the
              front end of the website, so as a developer we will need to be aware of these changes constantly in our field of work.
            <br><br>
              The job of designing a site that ensures when the users open the site/application they will see the relevant
              information that is easy to read. The complications that are arising now and in the future are the variety of
              devices with different screen sizes and resolutions, this will have to be considered every time we design.
              The use of different browsers, devices and operating systems needs to be considered when designing, as this
              means a lot of cross-platform, cross-browser and cross-device needs to be considered when planning.
            <br><br>
              Using the 2018 Burning Glass data, the IT job title, “Front end developer” is ranked 6th.
              The Front-End developer skills, using the Burning Glass data IT Skills 2018. The rankings are as follows -
              JavaScript ranked 2nd, Microsoft Windows ranked 4th, Microsoft C# ranked 12th, LINUX ranked 13th, .NET ranked 16th,
              Website development ranked 17th, and Git ranked 21st. Other programming languages used but are not included in
              Burning Glass data are HTML and CSS.

              Going over a few different job advertisements I have collected this list of generic skill requirements for
              front end developers, communications skills is an important skill no matter what job role you are in but for
              front end developers you need to be able to communicate with your superiors and team members throughout your job.
              Problem solving skills come into programming and been able to solve any problems that shall arise during your
              development of your websites/applications front end. Organisational skills are a must for any job but will be important
              in organising your workload which will include time management skills and meeting deadlines.

              I personally have not changed my mind on my ideal job role even after I have read and compared to others
              through Burning Glass data 2018 and the job role of front-end developer is still high on the list of jobs and skill.
              The role I have chosen is important in the IT industry and I will enjoy doing it for years to come with the small
              and large challenges I will face but in the end the job is very much achievable, exciting and plenty of opportunities
              to build from.

           <h2>Software Engineering</h2>
         
           <p>
               I would love to be a software engineer in the future. I love the idea of utilising both my logical and creative sides to design and improve new software. I would love to use and develop my written and verbal communication skills, problem-solving skills, and programming skills. Software engineering caters to many of my qualities as highlighted in its industry data. Another amazing facet of software engineering is its amazing demand score, which makes it a practical career to shoot for. 
           </p>
           <p>
               Software engineering has the eleventh highest demand score for IT-specific jobs in Australia and New Zealand as highlighted within the burning glass data. For reference, the demand for software engineers is higher than the demand for website developers, software developers and user experience designers. Not to mention, the jobs that are listed higher than software engineers mostly require the same IT-specific skillset. 
           </p>
           <p>
               The IT-specific skillset (hard skillset) for software engineers includes a range of programming languages e.g., Java, C#, and SQL. Software engineers need to know a wide range of programming languages because different employers have different software goals. Some companies may be searching for a software engineer to develop desktop applications, some may be searching for a software engineer to develop mobile applications, and some may want to hire a software engineer to organise data. There are a multitude of other reasons why a company may hire a software engineer, but the main reasons are the ones I have previously mentioned. Another reason a software engineer needs to know multiple programming languages is because each programming language is suited for a specific use. For example, Java is tailored to desktop applications and mobile applications, SQL is designed for adding, accessing, and managing content within a database, and C# is used for creating XML Web services and .NET applications. 
           </p>
           <p>
               Programming languages have an extremely high demand within the field of IT. The data demonstrates this fact with SQL, JavaScript, and Java taking the number one, two, and three spots, respectively. Software engineering even has its own place on the list, software engineering is the fifteenth place on the list of IT-specific skills that are in high demand. A benefit of a software engineer knowing multiple programming languages is that their adaptability will not only help them secure a job within the field of software engineering, but also change their job mid-career.
           </p>
           <p>
               While a software engineer’s knowledge in multiple programming languages can help them secure a job within another IT field, there are certain skills that are not required for software engineers that will prevent them from entering some IT-specific fields. These fields include but are not limited to system analysis, IT management, and data science. These fields require the highest-ranking skills that software engineers are not required to have. These skills are SAP (number 6), business management (number 7), and business analysis (number 9). With the hard skills of software engineers being entirely programming languages, you may assume that software engineers do not have effective communication skills. This is a popular misconception that has been made by numerous people, but it happens to be the opposite of the truth. 
           </p>
           <p>
               The general skills (soft skills) required for software engineering are some of the most in-demand general skills across all occupations. These skills include verbal communication, written communication, problem-solving, teamwork, planning, attention to detail, creativity, organisation, task prioritising, meeting deadlines, an analytical mindset, multitasking, and English. The most in-demand general skills are incredibly synchronised with the general skills required for becoming a software engineer. The top three most in-demand general skills required for software engineering include communication skills (number one), problem-solving skills (number two), and organisational skills (number three). The fact that not only the top three general skills, but also the top three IT-specific skills for software engineers are so highly ranked, is a true testament to the greatness of the role. The three most integral soft skills for software engineers are problem-solving skills, keen attention to detail, and multitasking skills.
           </p>
           <p>
               Problem-solving skills are essential for any software engineer because they need to develop effective and efficient solutions to problems. This could be when they are programming a new solution to a problem or debugging a program. Great problem-solving skills come from a variety of sources including creativity, critical thinking, and an innovative mindset. Critical thinking also happens to tie into the next skill. 
           </p>
           <p>
               Keen attention to detail is an essential skill for software engineers because they are required to be thorough while they are handling complex code, documents, and large projects. When handling complex code, attention to detail may save a program from encountering errors because of easily fixable problems. For example, without fantastic attention to detail, a programmer may encounter an error because of their poor spelling in a variable name or in programming language-specific keywords, or because they have flawed logic. In programming, these errors are referred to as syntax and logic errors. When handling documents, software engineers need to have keen attention to detail because they are required to have proper English, so a misspelled word or grammatical error would cause an issue. When handling large projects, software engineers need amazing attention to detail to not only fix their own, but others’ mistakes as well. Software engineers also need to utilise thorough testing protocols to make sure that readability is fantastic, which requires an extremely high level of attention to detail. Software engineers also need to have this extremely high level even when they are balancing multiple tasks at the same time. 
           </p>
           <p>
               Multitasking skills are integral to every software engineer because they may be required to work on multiple tasks simultaneously, while dealing with a tight deadline. Therefore, organisation and task prioritising are essential sub-skills for the software engineer’s utility belt. Multitasking is a balancing act that takes plenty of experience to perfect, but once perfected, it is one of the integral ingredients that create an excellent software engineer. Multitasking also happens to be one of the most in-demand general skills amongst all occupations. 
           </p>
           <p>
               The highest ranked general skills that are not required for software engineering are leadership (number 11), mentoring (number 13), and team building (number 18). All these skills are beneficial to software engineers, but they are not required for the role. This is because software engineers do not have to be team leaders but, if a software engineer has these general skills, it will heighten their job prospects and help them work better within a team. I believe that because I possess foundational skill in each of these areas, I will be a great fit for software engineering team leadership roles in the future. 
           </p>
           <p>
               In conclusion, software engineering is still my dream job because as I read about what they do, and the requirements for becoming one, I only got reassured that this is the right career path for me. Utilising both my creative and analytical skills is something that I require in my career, and software engineering has a beautiful harmony of the two. I love solving problems creatively and doing it for a living would be an incredible experience. While reading about the requirements in terms of skillset, I resonated with each of them, and the skills that I do not excel in are ones that I would love to master in the future. Also, the fact that not only the IT-specific skills, but the general skills as well, are the most in-demand skills within Australia and New Zealand, makes me even more comfortable pursuing the role. After my research, I feel more certain than ever that software engineering is the career for me.

           <h2>Ideal Job: Machine Learning Engineer </h2>

           <p>
           The primary responsibility of a machine learning engineer is to write software that interprets 
           large data sets. There are multiple fields currently in need of machine learning engineers as the 
           world collects more data every day; the scope has quickly reached a point where it is beyond the 
           ability of the human brain and will require computers or, more specifically, computer algorithms 
           to interpret and organise the data collected for a variety of different purposes.  
           <br><br>
           My knowledge and capabilities as they stand today would be no match for the complex and ever-evolving 
           field of machine learning. Still, I am undertaking a much less arduous task of human learning to 
           understand more about machine learning and hopefully gain the skills to help provide me with an 
           opportunity in the field. While ML may seem less attractive when represented in nothing but large 
           data sets and their interpretation. I see it as a new form of understanding and interpreting people. 
           As people, we have created a vast amount of data related to almost every aspect of our lives and experience 
           that machine learning will help us improve our own lives. 
           <br><br>
           How to write a program that writes itself? This is the question that drives machine learning engineers. AI 
           is one of the fastest-growing industries in IT today, as noted in Reigns' article and cited from the US bureau 
           of statistics (Gupta, 2021) “Over the past decade, the U.S. has seen a 21% increase in the number of AI jobs, 
           plus a 27% increase in AI-related job wages from 2010 to 2020”. The machine learning engineer career path is 
           increasing in demand and value. The industry of AI-related fields is growing exponentially as more and more 
           uses are found for its implementation. 
           <br><br>
           According to the article on Springboard (Silberstein, 2021) - “Essential technical skills for machine learning 
           engineers. The two most required skills for ML engineers are software engineering, including writing algorithms 
           that can search, sort and organise data and Data science skills, including fundamental knowledge of Python, SQL 
           and Java programming languages”. My current skill set is only scraping the surface of what is required to enter 
           the field of ML.  
           <br><br>
           According to the burning glass data, many of these skills are closely related to some of the most in-demand skills 
           within the IT industry, including the top programming languages. 
           <br><br>
           <ul>
              <li> -SQL, ranked number 1 </li>

               <li>-JavaScript, ranked number 2 </li>

               <li>-JAVA, ranked number 3 </li>
           </ul>
           A vital aspect of the machine learning role is proficiency across various programming languages. The languages 
           listed above represent only a small number of top-ranked languages currently in demand. Still, many more will be 
           required to fulfil the role of ML engineer. As I am still at the beginning of my journey towards this goal, I can 
           very quickly see these three languages as lacking in my skills tool kit and required to move forward into the 
           machine learning field. 
           <br><br>
           However, I feel multiple aspects of the job description suit my personality. Including the ability to think abstractly 
           and creatively interpret data sets. I am by nature detailed orientated and enjoy tasks that some can find repetitive 
           and boring. Most of the required general skills align very closely with jobs I am already doing and believe myself 
           to be good at; however, one notable area that I think I could work on would be domain knowledge. This is the ability 
           to understand what you are designing software to do, basically the link between the design and the customer. While 
           I believe I could do this, I would first need to understand what I was designing for. For example, I would be well 
           suited to be an ML engineer in a games field as I have a good knowledge base around games and could understand this 
           domain better than others. 
           <br><br>
           Within the above skills, the burning-glass data outlines many general skills that align with the role of an ML engineer, 
           including 
           <br><br>
           <h3>-Communication Skills: </h3>
           Ranked number one as an ML engineer, a large portion of the job is related to communicating between teams of people 
           working on different parts of programs. These groups included data scientists and programmers, all essential in creating 
           algorithms used in machine learning. 
           <br><br>
           <h3>-Problem Solving: </h3>
           Ranked number 2, this is a genera4lised skill but valuable for anyone working in programming or software engineering. 
           Machine Learning on its own is problem-solving at a very high-level requiring solutions to problems too big for one 
           or even many people to solve or comprehend and requiring computers to interoperate the data. 
           <br><br>
           <h3>-Creativity: </h3>
           Ranked 9th, it is essential in almost every field, but especially in ML; as a new and emerging field of technology, 
           it is necessary to remain open to new ideas and new ways of doing things. As well as coming up with new ideas and 
           ways of doing things yourself. 
           <br><br>
           Machine Learning will, at one point or another, during the performing of daily duties, require at least the top 12 
           generic skills, according to the burning glass data. And depending on the speciality, all of the leading general skills 
           mentioned in the data will come into play at one point or another. 
           <br><br>
           There are multiple areas as far as a technical ability where I would need to increase my understanding through learning 
           to become an ML engineer. Some of the most currently in-demand skills in this list include Amazon machine learning, 
           Google Cloud Machine Learning and multiple programming languages. As I begin to program and understand the number of 
           languages out there, not to mention the new languages being created every day, I think the most critical technical 
           aptitude a machine learning engineer can possess is learning new skills in a relatively short space of time. Due to 
           the broad knowledge base required to become an ML engineer, most of the technical aptitudes needed to become one are in 
           demand across the IT industry and provide excellent work opportunities.  
           <br><br>
           Looking over the burning glass data related to the field of an ML engineer has not changed my opinion or the outlook on 
           the role itself. Still, I understand there will be multiple challenges to achieving this career. While I find the career 
           is suited to my aspirations and goals, I will have to complete a large amount of study to be considered for most positions. 
           I see a likely outcome; given the amount of study involved, I will probably end up in a software engineer role before I reach 
           ML engineer but provided, I continue to study, I will have an opportunity to enter this field eventually.

        <div id="Levian">
         <p>
             Levian desires to become a generalist programmer. Generalist programmers require a brilliant combination of IT-specific skills (hard skills) and general skills (soft skills). Generalist programmers can be broadly defined as “all-rounders” that need to know both frontend and backend programming languages to succeed within their role. With their generalistic approach to programming considered, they will need to have effective communication skills to propel collaboration with a wide range of developers and IT-engineers.
         </p>
         <p>
             The three highest ranking IT-specific skills ranked by demand that a generalist programmer must have in their skillset are a deep proficiency in multiple programming languages in both the frontend and backend, building relationships, and website production.
         </p>
         <p>
             Generalist programmers need to be fluent in multiple programming languages that specialise in both frontend development and backend development, because they must be effective for developing a range of applications, and are often required to switch between frontend development and backend development. The three highest ranking programming languages that generalist programmers will need to have in their toolbox are SQL (number 1), JavaScript (number 2), and Java (number 3). SQL is essential for a generalist programmer because they may be required to work on databases instead of websites and software. JavaScript is a necessary asset to any generalist programmer because it is excellent for website development and website application development. Java on the other hand, is most useful for desktop applications and mobile applications. These three programming languages combined will provide someone with plenty of knowledge, but to become a generalist programmer, they will often be required to know more programming languages than the three I have previously mentioned.
         </p>
         <p>
             Building relationships is a must have skill for generalist programmers because they are required to have open communication with their team members so they can help the team out whenever they are required to. Building relationships is the eighth highest ranking IT-specific skill in terms of demand.
         </p>
         <p>
             Website production is the seventeenth highest ranking IT-specific skill, and it is essential for generalist programmers because they must be proficient in all aspects of programming. The website-specific programming languages they must be proficient in are HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. HTML is an essential programming language for a generalist programmer because it is the foundation of all websites, and CSS and JavaScript are crucial for creating beautiful displays. JavaScript is the most useful programming language for a generalist programmer because it has the widest range of applications, therefore suiting the generalist programmer’s style perfectly. This versatility combined with its high demand is why it is the most useful programming language for a generalist programmer to learn.
         </p>
         <p>
             The three highest ranking IT-specific skills in terms of demand that are not critical for a generalist programmer to have are project management (number 5), SAP (number 6), and business management (number 7). Project management is a non-essential skill for generalist programmers because they do not manage projects because they are required to do odd jobs instead. SAP, and business management are also non-essential skills for generalist programmers because they are business related skills, rather than programming related skills. Just because these skills are not required for generalist programmers and they happen to be business related skills, it does not mean that generalist programmers do not require general types of skills.
         </p>
         <p>
             The three highest ranking general skills in terms of demand that are required for generalist programmers are communication skills (number 1), problem-solving skills (number 2), and organisational skills (number 3).
         </p>
         <p>
             Communication skills are integral to a generalist programmers’ skill set because they allow for greater collaboration, and productivity. Communication skills allow these boosts because they are critical for open communication, effective communication, and properly elaborating problems.
         </p>
         <p>
             Problem-solving skills are essential for any programmer, but they are especially useful for generalist programmers because they are required to solve problems within various programming environments. Excellent problem-solving skills help to make a program be produced efficiently, and that there will be no bugs within the program. The productivity of problem-solving skills is also increased as the organisation of the code is refined.
         </p>
         <p>
             Organisational skills are critical for generalist programmers because without them, a program will be defined as “spaghetti code.” Spaghetti code is a programming term for code that is unnecessarily difficult to read. With organisational skills, generalist programmers can avoid spaghetti code, therefore creating beautifully organised code that other programmers can read with ease. The readability of code helps programmers work faster while they are collaborating, which is why organisational skills are so essential.
         </p>
         <p>
             The three general skills that are the highest ranked by demand, which are non-essential skills for generalist programmers are leadership skills (number 11), mentoring skills (number 13), and presentation skills (number 15). Leadership skills are non-critical skills for generalist programmers because they are not applicable to generalist programmers’ duties. The generalist programmers’ duties are receiving tasks from other programmers rather than generating tasks for the team. Mentoring skills are not required for generalist programmers because of a similar reason to the reason leadership skills are non-critical, specifically, they do not need mentoring skills because they do not manage teams. Presentation skills are non-essential for generalist programmers because they do not present content, and do not communicate directly with management during their duties.
         </p>
         <p>
             In conclusion, becoming a generalist programmer is an excellent career choice because the skills that they require, are extremely applicable to many roles not only in IT, but also in many other jobs. I cannot speak for Levian, but my opinion has changed after looking at the burning glass data. I previously believed that because generalist programmers do not require an extremely elevated level of communication, their job would not be as adaptable as a software engineer’s is. While it is true that software engineers have greater adaptability when it comes to their career, generalist programmers also have excellent adaptability. Generalist programming is also a brilliant career choice because it has extremely high adaptability within their daily duties, therefore reducing mundane activities. Having an adaptable experience is the core exciting aspect of generalist programming, and I am excited for Levian’s future because they have made a wonderful choice of career.
