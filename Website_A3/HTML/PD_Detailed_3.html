        <h2>Testing</h2>

        <p>
            Article on Game Testing Methods - 
            <a href="https://powerup-gaming.com/2020/04/19/5-types-of-video-game-testing-methods/" target="_blank">Article</a> 
            <br><br>
            The cite mentioned above is an article about 5 forms of testing video games, the methods of testing being 
            functionality, regression, compatibility, load, and play. Functionality testing is about ensuring the game 
            works properly. This is done by searching for any bugs and errors that could make the game freeze, crash, 
            experience performance loss, unplayable in terms of controls, etc. This form of testing takes time, this is 
            due to the testers having to try out every function of the game so that they can find any bugs or errors. 
            The second testing method is regression, which is the method of looking through any potentially unchanged 
            code right before an update, to ensure that the updated changes do not mess up the program. The third test 
            is a compatibility test, a method of testing used to ensure that the game in question runs on the hardware, 
            software, and graphics that it was built for. This method checks that all text is visible, the UI (User 
            Interface) does not have any issues with different screen resolutions, and that different systems can run 
            the game smoothly. The fourth testing method is the load test, a method used to check if the game runs 
            smoothly when multiple people are playing. This type of testing is mostly important for MMOs (massively 
            multiplayer online role-playing games) because these types of games will potentially have thousands of 
            users online at once. The fifth method is play testing, which is used to test out the non-functional 
            features, such as balancing, difficulty, spawn rates, and how fun the game is to play. 
            <br><br>
            For Solus Miles, the team will implement 4 out of 5 testing methods that the article discusses, these are 
            the functionality, regression, compatibility, and play testing. We will test out functionality by running 
            the code whenever we make major changes, to ensure that the code runs smoothly without taking too much 
            computational power. The regression testing is especially important as we will have three people working on 
            the code separately, so any major changes that one would make needs to be checked to see if they would harm 
            the game. Compatibility testing is less important for Solus Miles, as the game is meant to be playable by 
            anyone with a working keyboard and screen, however, we will need to test that the multiple resolutions we 
            will be implementing will work with as little issues as possible. The team will get the opportunity to play 
            test the game close to the submission deadline, approximately one week beforehand. If we can develop the 
            main code with minimal issues, the entire team will have a hand in play testing and can provide their 
            thoughts on balance improvements. 
            <br><br>
            To tell that we have succeeded in each method of testing, the team will have to complete a checklist for 
            each testing method. For functionality, the checklist will be written during testing, the tester will have 
            to add in any issues that they find. Afterwards, the checklist will have its items marked off when the code
            has been updated and more functionality testing is done, so that the changes are ensured. Regression 
            testing will be considered done when all changes in the code are documented, either through the tester or 
            GitHub’s history tab, and have been cleared as “does not affect unchanged code”. Compatibility testing will, 
            like functionality, have its checklist created during testing by the tester, all issues to do with the 
            screen’s resolution must be recorded and then resolved as soon as possible. Game testing is a form of testing 
            to be done roughly a week before submission, so this will give the entire team a chance to try out the game 
            during a meeting and reply with their thoughts on the game and how it can be improved. For this section to 
            be considered complete, our team will have to try out different balancing methods within the code in between 
            play testing sessions to ensure that everyone gives our creation a solid 10/10.

        <h2>Risks</h2>

        <p>
            Our project is huge; therefore, it comes with many risks. These risks range from software-based risks to 
            team-chemistry risks. Many of these issues are unlikely but are worth taking into consideration. The 
            software-based risks for this project are bound to the tools we have listed which are Pygame, GitHub, 
            Aseprite, and Visual Studio. 
            <br><br>
            The risks that are associated with Pygame are poor optimisation, learning difficulty, poor documentation, 
            features, and reliability. If pygame has poor optimisation, it will be detrimental to our project because 
            one of our key focuses is playability on a variety of levels of computing power. The volatility of this 
            particular risk to the project is extremely high because we would not have the ability to easily fix this 
            problem. We would have to rebuild the program to meet our optimisation goal. 
            Pygame’s difficulty could prove to be a nuisance if it is more difficult than we expect. If Pygame is more 
            difficult, our project idea would be much harder to execute, and we would have to put significantly more 
            resources into producing an acceptable deliverable. This fact makes Pygame’s difficulty level a huge risk 
            that we must consider when pursuing our project’s completion. 
            Poor documentation may also hinder our ability to produce a decent proof of concept because it can be the 
            difference between easily fixing bugs, and spending hours on a bug that should be a quick fix. Poor 
            documentation would also increase the difficulty of learning Pygame exponentially, which would also make 
            producing a great deliverable much more laborious. We must consider these facts while we are moving forward 
            with our project. This issue is somewhat easier to fix than the rest, but it does take some time, as the 
            writer of a section of code will have to go back and add in justification comments as to why what was 
            written was written, instead of something else.
            <br><br>
            If Pygame does not have the features we need to complete our project, we will encounter various problems. 
            These problems include an inability to meet our goals, an inability to create a working deliverable, and a 
            higher effort requirement for creating the features that Pygame may lack. A lack of features within the 
            Pygame library may ensue in an inability to meet our goals because we may have to cut features that could be 
            dependent on Pygame containing certain components. If Pygame does not include the necessary features for 
            our project's completion, it may also result in an inability to create a working deliverable without 
            creating the features that Pygame would lack. This would make the project take an exponentially higher 
            amount of effort to complete, therefore, making it a valid risk to consider. 
            The final concern with using Pygame is the risk of utilising an unreliable product. If Pygame is unreliable, 
            the game would be exceedingly more difficult to develop. This risk would have many risks interconnected 
            with unreliability such as creating bugs, hitting roadblocks, and forcing a restructure of the project. 
            If the potential unreliability of Pygame results in unforeseen bugs, it would cause the project to progress 
            significantly slower than if it were reliable. Another interconnected risk that would hinder the project’s 
            progress is the potential of hitting roadblocks which may be connected to the creation of bugs, and a chance 
            of forcing us to restructure the entire project. Given these issues, it is of the utmost importance that we 
            consider the potential of Pygame being unreliable while creating our project. 
            <br><br>
            GitHub is another platform that we will employ, and therefore, has risks attached to it. These risks may 
            also result in roadblocks, and other delays, because if GitHub were to have a server outage, for example, 
            we would be unable to continue working on our project during the outage. This is because we intend to 
            utilise GitHub to handle our version control, therefore, making a server outage severely detrimental to 
            our project’s progression. 
            <br><br>
            Aseprite is the tool Adam will be using, and is a big risk considering he had started using it during the 
            second assessment, so the potential pitfalls of Aseprite include software shortcomings that would make the 
            creation of pixel art take longer than it would other editors and the learning of this new software, which 
            like every new thing, will take some time to get used to, another issue is of how many members of the team 
            know how to create art in the pixel art style. 
            The shortcomings of Aseprite could include the lack of art editor features and exportation issues. The 
            features an editor would need to perform at optimal capacity are mainly about rotating, copying, or 
            choosing the colour of a selected section of art. This feature is not at all necessary for the editor to 
            work but would make the creations within much faster to create, so while it may seem there is no issue, a 
            lack of editor features would considerably slow down the creation process. The next issue that may occur 
            is exportation, with questions such as “will it export for free?”, “can it export images into multiple 
            sizes and file formats, such as jpeg or Png?”, and “does the exporting process happen automatically or will 
            it require extra work for each exportation?”. So far, these potential issues will mainly affect the time it 
            takes to work on an image, however, if they do occur then this would slow the art section down to a halt, 
            as Adam will have to reuse his old art editor, Piskel, and redraw his designs for exportation. 
            Another issue to consider is how long it would take to learn the new software. This possibility will not 
            take too long to amend, as knowing how to draw in a pixel art style is the main factor, and one that does 
            not change from editor to editor. The factors that would take time to get used to include the differences 
            in buttons between Aseprite and Piskel, how the images are saved in each, exporting images, and how well 
            Adam is able to adapt to the new software. This is foreseen to take, at most, 2 days, as this issue is not 
            a very big one but will take some getting used to. Adam is the only member of the team who knows how to 
            draw in a pixel art style, and so he will be completing all the artworks that the team will use for the 
            game. It would take time for the other members to learn this skill, something that we do not have. So, to 
            solve this issue, the rest of the team is tasked with critiquing the artworks made into something the 
            whole team can agree on. 
            <br><br>
            During the creation of our project, we also intend to utilise Visual Studio which will certainly have some 
            heavy risks considering our expected usage amount. The foreseeable risks that utilising Visual Studio to 
            such an extent will provide are operating system compatibility, a high learning curve, and Visual Studio 
            Live Share not working well.  
            Due to James’ computer running the mac operating system, a risk of heavily using Visual Studio may be 
            running into some compatibility issues. This risk is further inflated by the fact that Microsoft owns 
            Visual Studio. Due to Microsoft owning Visual Studio, they are likely to enhance the Windows version before 
            enhancing the mac version. This may result in compatibility problems that may hurt James’ ability to work 
            with the program, therefore, hurting his ability to work with the team on our project.  
            Considering most of our team members have not tried Visual Studio previously, we may run into some learning 
            difficulties. This is a risk to be considered because it may slow down the project’s progression, and we 
            may have to utilise different IDEs. If we utilise different IDEs, we may run into issues because of the 
            distinct differences of the software. 
            During the process of creating our project, we intend to utilise the Visual Studio Live Share extension. 
            This will come with various risks such as not having the features we need, operating system compatibility, 
            and a high level of adjustment. If the Visual Studio Live Share extension does not have the features we 
            need, we will have to approach collaboration in a different way than we intended. We would have to setup 
            times that each of us will work on the project, so that we do not overwrite each other’s GitHub commitments. 
            This would be a huge hassle, and it would make collaboration much more difficult than we expect. 
            If the base version of Visual Studio does run efficiently on the mac operating system, we may still end up 
            hitting a wall with the Live Share extension’s compatibility. This would also force us to re-evaluate our 
            approach towards collaboration. If Live Share does have this problem, we must change our approach to 
            collaboration, but we would only have to take James’ GitHub commits into account when re-evaluating our 
            schedules. 
            The final risk that comes with utilising Visual Studio Live Share is the high level of adjustment that 
            would occur with team collaboration. This could be for a plethora of reasons, but the most likely are the 
            way it differs from collaborating via a word document, and the collaborative programming experience of our 
            members. Considering our team is used to collaborating via word documents, using Visual Studio Live Share 
            has a chance to be difficult to learn because of its differences. If we cannot collaborate using Visual 
            Studio Live Share because of the difference to collaborating via a word document, we will be forced to 
            change our approach to collaboration, which will come with difficulties. The learning curve of this 
            adjustment may result in slower progression, and frustration among team members. Progressing through 
            developing our program at a sedated pace will be a significant issue. The other significant problem with 
            the potential of a high learning curve is a distain of completing the project due to the difficulties that 
            Visual Studio Live Share may bring. Therefore, this is a problem which could result in many team-chemistry 
            related issues such as a lack of contributions, slow productivity, and communication issues. 
            <br><br>
            Team-chemistry issues may occur for numerous other reasons such as the addition of a new team member, 
            members putting in minimal effort towards the project, and communication-based problems. While we are 
            working on the project, we will have to be prepared for each of these risks, so we can destroy them before 
            they become a larger problem.  
            The addition of Marc to our team is a risk because the change to our team’s dynamic may be difficult for 
            all of us. While we are working with Marc, and adjusting to the new pacing, we must remember to be malleable 
            with our workflow and our style of communication. If our workflow is not malleable, we may face difficulties 
            while working with Marc because Marc may be unable to work with our current workflow dynamic. If our style 
            of communication is not malleable, Marc may become frustrated, which could affect productivity, and the 
            team’s overall morale. 
            If any of us are disgruntled, we may face the issue of disgruntled members lacking the contributions that 
            they must provide the team with. Another issue that may result in a lack of effort towards the project is 
            the inability to make time for it. If this is an issue for any of our team members, the team member in 
            question must notify the other members before this problem is enlarged. If we cannot solve the problem 
            before it is enlarged, it will be a huge risk to the completion of the project. 
            The two previously mentioned team-chemistry risks can likely be avoided if we can tip-toe around the risk 
            of poor communication. If we have poor communication, our project will be exponentially more difficult to 
            deliver, as a matter of fact, this is likely to be the most important risk to consider. Creating a 
            functioning deliverable will be extremely difficult if we have poor communication because many of the 
            previously listed risks are likely to occur, which means that terrible communication will have a 
            flow-through affect that will destroy our project in every way imaginable. That is why we must always be 
            thinking about this risk, and how we may be able to improve upon our communication for this project. 
        </p>

        <h2>Group Processes and Communication</h2>

        <p>
            Communication is a facet of group collaboration that we must improve upon from our last assessment task. 
            We have had decent communication, but it is of the utmost importance that we elevate our communication to 
            an exemplary level. By defining how we will be communicating and how often we are expected to communicate, 
            we will achieve brilliant communication during this project. 
            Our communication during this assessment task will be done solely through Microsoft Teams. We will be using 
            Microsoft Teams to arrange and perform our bi-weekly meetings and communicate via the group chat when we 
            have questions and updates that cannot wait. We will be expected to be available to respond to group chat 
            messages at a minimum of every two days to maximise the level of communication. If one of our group members 
            does not respond to communicative efforts via meetings or the group chat, we will treat them as a 
            non-contributor, and their lack of communication will be reflected upon in the feedback section of the 
            assignment, and in the contribution form. On a related note, if a group member does not communicate with 
            the team at least twice per week, we will not hesitate to account for their lack of communication into the 
            feedback section, and the contribution form.
