        <h2>GitHub</h2>
        
        <p>
            GitHub was used as a collaboration tool with this assessment and the previous evaluations. We allowed all 
            team members to monitor and edit the HTML used to present our team website. We also used GitHub to 
            collaborate on the python code used to create our major project during the current evaluation.
            By downloading GitHub for desktop, which created a local repository for our game code for each team member, 
            we were able to push and commit changes to the warehouse. This was not without some challenges as, in some 
            cases, we would have multiple team members working at one time and attempting to commit or pull changes at 
            the exact moment. This did lead to some downtime where team members were locked out of the ability to make 
            changes to the repo as other team members were working, but for the most part, this tool proved to be more 
            helpful than hindered acne to the overall process. 
        </p>

        <h2>Microsoft Teams</h2>

        <p>
            A helpful tool, as with the last assessment, this was the primary tool used by all members and, in 
            conjunction with the entire MS Office suite, proved to be integral for the whole of the team to collaborate 
            on the team document and the creation of multiple other aspects of the collaboration process including team 
            meetings and instant messages.
            This tool was used as the primary means of communication for the entire team. Sometimes this proved a little 
            complicated as we shared documents or images in the chat that were not stored in the files section and 
            proved hard to find later as we were forced to scroll through pages of discussion to see where a particular 
            document had been previously shared rather than being able to find it in the shared files in a folder, 
            something I'm sure the majority of the team would suggest as productive feedback for the MS Teams 
            development team. Beyond this minor issue, we all found teams to perform adequately for messaging and team 
            meetings allowing us to share our screens and information effortlessly. 
        </p>

        <h2>Visual Studio</h2>

        <p>
            This assessment had us using Visual Studio (VS) and VS Code, two very similar IDEs that differ from more 
            than just an appended “Code” to the name. VS has been used for its SharePoint feature as it has allowed 
            multiple members of the team to work together on the game instead of having to go through a “one at a time” 
            approach, something that has considerably sped up our coding time. VS Code has been used by the members of 
            our team who could not download the “community” version of VS, which is the version that allowed SharePoint. 
            Thanks to GitHub Desktop, we were all able to grab the repository from GitHub and integrate with either VS 
            or VS Code to edit the program without having to commit every change on the website, which would have been 
            far more work. From Desktop, we were then able to push the changes made back into the main repository.  

            Setting up our A3 repository to work with visual studio was not an easy task and required some extra setup 
            and steps so that every member of our active team could contribute to the code. Our more knowledgeable 
            members had helped the rest set up GitHub Desktop to work with the correct repository and on Visual Studio 
            and Code, knocking out the task during one meeting. An issue we ran into afterwards was the file structure, 
            which, because of an incorrect setup by 3 out of 4 active members meant that we had to deal with the issue 
            during a future meeting, after the cause of the issue was identified by Adam. 
        </p>

        <h2>Aseprite</h2>

        <p>
            Used for the artwork creation and primarily by the team member tasked with creating the ordinal artwork that 
            features throughout our major project. Used for creating the pixel art, Aseprite is an application utilised 
            by Adam to make the player, room, alien, menu, etc. This application has been used since the second 
            assessment, as sample artworks have been created for the entire team to review and provide feedback on. The 
            third assessment had Adam take those samples and begin work on the finalized versions of each, which the 
            entire team was once again tasked with reviewing and providing feedback. No major issues were created out of 
            the use of Aseprite, as the application had worked as well as it had to during its duration of use.
