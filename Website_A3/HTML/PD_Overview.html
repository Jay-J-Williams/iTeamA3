        <h2>Topic</h2>

        <p>
            Our project is designed to be an ambitious videogame for players of all ages, and playstyles to enjoy. Our 
            core focuses for this project are optimisation, challenging and strategic gameplay, and a compelling 
            round-based experience. This project will be optimised for computers of all kinds, fast and slow. 
            Optimisation is a key focus of this project because we believe that anyone should have the ability to play 
            this wonderful game. Challenging and strategic gameplay is a primary focus for this project because we have 
            found that many video games underutilize these key areas of the player’s experience. We know that the 
            players who love both key aspects of video games need to have the experience they crave, and that is one of 
            the reasons that supports both the gameplay focuses, and the prioritisation of optimisation. Our final core 
            focus ties into both previously mentioned focuses. The round-based experience is a key focus of our video 
            game because we need to provide challenge fans and strategy fans with an experience which has an extremely 
            high replay value, so that we can give them the experience they crave over a prolonged period. 
            <br><br>
            The optimisation aspects of the round-based experience will be crucial for their experience to be excellent 
            because the users must be able to have a fluent experience with the game, rather than a choppy unpolished 
            experience. This project’s outcome will be fantastic for anyone who enjoys video games with brilliant 
            implementations of challenging and strategic elements. This project will be even more fantastic for them 
            because of the low hardware requirements, therefore, letting anyone with a computer and a passion for the 
            previously mentioned elements to jump right into the game and have an excellent time. The final key item 
            which will cater to the user’s experience in a significant manner is the round-based mode. We see the 
            round-based mode being essential to the user’s enjoyment, and we are sure that it will provide the project 
            with a brilliant aspect which will be combined with the aforementioned elements to create an awesome game 
            for all players who love challenging and strategic video games.

        <h2>Motivation</h2>

        <p>
            For Solus Miles, we have decided to create the game in a retro style, which gives it the characteristics of 
            nostalgia and playability on all devices. The story and gameplay or two very important aspects of the full 
            game as both these aspects will capture our audience. The story is, unfortunately, an aspect of the game we 
            do not have time to create within our timeframe and so had to be excluded from the “feasible version”, 
            gameplay however, can be done, and will be done, in the form of the “Swarm Mode”. This mode is a round-based 
            experience that increases difficulty and enemies after the previous round has been completed and will make 
            our “feasible version” a fun experience for anyone. The 4 weapons we have decided upon in A2 will help with 
            our player’s experience as each weapon has their drawbacks and strengths, something best learned after going 
            round after round in “Swarm Mode”. This game will incorporate a difficulty setting, as “easy”, “normal”, and 
            “hard” modes do not take up too much time to create in our timeframe and will give our players the ability 
            to play a tough challenge. All these aspects of Solus Miles are not the only ones we are incorporating, but 
            are a few of the most important ones, and each aspect has been designed to enhance the player experience in 
            their own way, whether it be playstyle or a challenging experience.  
            <br><br>
            Games in the market these days are mostly focused on graphics, this focus causes a limitation on playable 
            devices as better graphics require better specs. Solus Miles is a game with the aim of being playable on 
            any device, to do this we have decided to make “wow” graphics our final concern and create a game in the 
            pixel art style, which is an art style proven to be popular with indie games by the current game market. 
            The gaming industry is a major section of IT, and so there will always be the trend of what is popular, 
            Solus Miles does not aim to move outside the boundaries of what is trending and is not being created to 
            showcase something new, none of our members have the skill for something of this scale yet. Our game, 
            instead, is being made for anyone who wants to have some fun, wherever they are.
            The full project would show future employers that each member can work within a team, think outside of the 
            box, research and develop interesting ideas, put a twist on existing ideas no one would see coming, and are 
            willing to learn, progress, and improve whenever we must. Essentially, by completing this project we would 
            be able to showcase to potential employers that we are employable, motivated, and are willing to go above 
            and beyond to create something amazing out of something cliché.

        <h2>Landscape</h2>

        <p>
            Today's market for computer games could be considered overly saturated. A game like the one we plan to 
            design is like games that already exist on the market today. A good example would be the Microsoft title 
            Halo where an elite solider is tasked with fighting multiple types of alien enemies through various levels 
            and maps. 
            What sets us apart from competitors is our story. While there are many games on the market today, the market 
            itself is growing quickly and now finds itself in a remarkably similar space to most modern media formats 
            such as film and TV. There are many genres, and no one accepted standard for any game format. The popular 
            game Alien isolation based on the Movie Alien features similar themes to our own game, Solus Miles, only 
            serves to illustrate the power of a relevant story and the growing connection between modern media formats 
            including games.
            Our game, as it stands, will be simplistic and what would be classified as an indie title and our format RPG 
            or role-playing game are not unique by themselves. Still, our story will set us apart from the rest and 
            provide players with a new experience we hope they will enjoy.
