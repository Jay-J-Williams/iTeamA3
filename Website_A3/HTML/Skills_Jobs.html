            The positions listed below take in to account the skills already brought to the project by the team. The 
            positions we have selected are designed to enhance our own abilities and provide the best opportunities 
            to complete our vision and bring it to market. The positions would all be secondary to roles already 
            fulfilled by the team. 
            Assuming that by being able to hire 4 people in full time roles we have chosen to write job ads to fill 
            each position. 3 full time roles and 3 casual/part time roles that could be filled by a singular mentor 
            role or game designer. We would not be guaranteed to find a full time Gamer Designer to fill this role, so 
            we have split it into the 3 casual roles to ensure the support needed to complete the game is filled. 
            Allowing us to split a full-time wage among 3 casuals also increase the number of unique views we can bring 
            to the table. 
        </p>

        <h2>Programmer</h2>

        <p>
            <b>Full Time: 38 hrs/wk.</b>

            > Object Oriented Programming
            <br><br>

            <b>Role</b> <br>
            We are a small game development start up producing our first title in need of a junior game programmer to 
            help us complete the project. The junior programmer would have to have experience in python with it being 
            preferred if they were to have experience using pygame or some at least some experience programming or 
            making their own games at a minimum.  
            It would be expected that this role would be full time but available to work remotely if required. The 
            successful applicant will be expected to take full ownership of the code from start to finish and be 
            comfortable taking creative direction from the team and bring their own ideas to the project to improve the 
            functionality of the code. 
        </p>

        <h2>Artist</h2>

        <p>

            Proficiency in (pixel art program) required as well as any other applicable design applications. With every 
            new idea we will expect to be provided with iterations in terms of colour and style. Experience in animation 
            is preferred as every design will require multiple frames to create animations within the game.
            This role will report directly to our Art Director Adam who will provide direction and feedback as required.
            For the right applicant, this role could provide a create outlet where they get to see their work come to 
            life in our latest game title. 
        </p>

        <h2>Sales/Marketing</h2>

        <p>
            <b>Full Time: 38 hrs/wk.</b>
            <br><br>

            <b>Experience</b> <br> 
            > Sales <br>
            > Marketing <br>
            > Games <br>

            > Analysis 
            <br><br>

            <b>Role</b> <br>
            It will be expected that the role will be filled by someone with marketing experience preferably in the 
            games or media industry. Crucially the successful applicant will have a solid understanding of social 
            media and all current marketing trends for games.  
            Coming in early in the development of the game it will also be expected that this role will help with 
            market testing, finding beta testers, conducting market research, and communicating the findings back to 
            the team. We will be using the insights to help build the final product and ensure the best possible 
            experience for our players. 
            This role will be full time and expected to be onsite and in attendance during team meetings to present 
            research findings. 
        </p>

        <h2>Game Design</h2>

        <p>
            <b>Full Time: 38 hrs/wk.</b>
            <br><br>
            The game design role may not be filled by one person and is used as a place holder role for expertise', 
            some of which we have already identified and some we have not. Some we have identified include sound 
            design and playability. This role could be filled in a consulting capacity by an already successful indie 
            game designer that would be willing to spend time with the team and provide insights and feedback on the 
            game and its features. 
            Assuming we may not be able to find a candidate who will be able to fulfill the role we have also taken the 
            opportunity to split the above mentor role into three sub roles that could be filled by part time or casual 
            employees to fill the team's needs. 
            <br><br>
            <b>Part Time or Casual, based on business needs</b>
        </p>

        <h4>Sound Design</h4>

        <p>
            A crucial part of any game is creating an immersive soundscape, while this would not require a fulltime 
            commitment, we feel that to present a fully completed game to the market bringing on someone with 
            experience creating sounds preferably with a background in games will help polish our game for introduction 
            to the market. The preferred candidate will have experience creating and implementing unique sound effects.  
        </p>

        <h4>Visuals</h4>

        <p>
            Dependant on the ability of the above-mentioned artist position a part time role may be required to fill in 
            visual short falls such as animation. Primarily the Visuals role listed here would be responsible for 
            adapting the artist's work into a playable game design and vice versa. This person should have game 
            development experience and be able to not only provide ideas on how to achieve a visual experience within 
            the game environment but be able to adapt the teams' ideas into visual experiences for the player to create 
            an immersive world. 
            This person is seen as the intermediary between the programmer and the artist translating the artists 
            intentions into the programmer. 
        </p>

        <h4>Playability</h4>

        <p>
            A unique role well suited to someone with experience launching their own indie title or with enough 
            experience within the games industry to offer mentorship to the team to help produce the best player 
            experience. Niccole Lazaro Author of the Four Keys to Fun or Jesse Schell are good examples of the candidate 
            we would hope to find to fill this role. Both would be able to offer a world of advice into the playability 
            of our game.  
            This candidate would focus on the game story and converting the story into something that provides and 
            exceptional player experience. It is expected that this role would communicate with the programmer, artist 
            and sales and marketing roles to ensure that our game is successful in today's market.
