            <h2>Adam Profile</h2>
            <p>
                My name is Adam Saleh, my student number is S3940024. My hobbies include playing video games 
                (Assassin’s Creed, Skyrim, Dragon Ball XenoVerse, Halo, Sonic), watching movies (Expendables, 
                Terminator, Rocky, The Mummy, Spiderman), tv shows (The Flash, Big Bang Theory, Futurama, 
                Simpsons, One Piece), and abridged series (SAO Abridged, DBZ Abridged, Yu-Gi-Oh Abridged). 
                I’ve done pixel art for a few months and started trying out blender (I made a list of hotkeys) 
                because I'm interested in design as a hobby. The IT jobs I'm most interested in are software 
                development and game development. 
                <br><br>
                My interest In IT is mainly in programming, machine learning, robots, and the potential of 
                artificial intelligence, however my skills and experience are very little. I started IT last 
                year with the Cert III in IT with Tafe. After the Cert III, came the Cert IV in Programming 
                which taught someone who couldn’t even display “hello world” C#, SQL, HTML, CSS, and JS . I 
                taught myself a little bit of Python (Py game) and Java (J Frame) before starting this course. 
                <br><br>
                My Myers-Briggs personality is the ISTP-T Turbulent Virtuoso, this personality type is 
                described as rationalized, curious, and creators, they prefer pulling things apart to put 
                them back together, usually better than it was before. They are known as friendly, private, 
                curious, overhasty and practically realistic. An ISTP’s strengths include being optimistic, 
                energetic, creative, practical, spontaneous, rational, prioritisation, composed, and excellent 
                at handling a crisis. Their weaknesses include being stubborn, insensitive, private, easily 
                bored, disliking commitment, and risky behaviour. 
                <br><br>
                The learning style best suited to me is the pragmatist style, a style that learns best from 
                practical, case studies, problem setting, and discussions. A pragmatist is keen to try out 
                ideas/theories to see if they work, search new ideas, and take the first opportunity to test 
                an application. My secondary learning style, of the same score (0.250), is the reflector style, 
                this style learns best with paired discussions, self-analysis questionnaires, demonstrations, 
                feedback, and coaching. The reflector style of learning is more about observing, data gathering
                and analysing than it is the practical approach.  
                <br><br>
                The two workstyle tests I’ve done have indicated that I am an “integrator” and an organised 
                planner. An integrator’s preferred roles are problem-solving and diagnostics with a strong 
                preference for understanding the why of what’s being done. They are known to be self-reliant 
                and prefer the “plan-first” approach. The second of the tests that I’ve done indicates that my 
                preferred way of work is to organize and plan my work, which, as proven by working with this 
                team, is where my strengths lie.  
                <br><br>
                For iTeam, a name I support, I should be able to help organize the work that needs to be done, 
                come up with creative solutions or ideas, prioritise my duties based on time and importance, 
                try out software that is new to me without hesitation, create creative code for the project, 
                and, if need be, I will discuss our course of actions if I do not agree with them. This doesn’t 
                mean I don’t have my weaknesses though, everyone does. As I’ve learnt from the tests I’ve done, 
                and personal experience, my weaknesses within iTeam might just include leaving important but 
                boring tasks until the end, an approach to explanations that lack a practical containing less 
                than ideal memorisations, and getting my tasks done early on and expecting most, if not all, 
                to take a similar approach.

            <h2>Career Plan</h2>
            <p>My ideal job is to become a software developer and create the software that any business or 
                company might need. To become a software developer, I plan to obtain the necessary skills to 
                go above and beyond in this field. My current plan involves taking all programming related 
                courses this bachelor has to offer, such as the “Web Programming” core 1 subject, the 
                “Programming Project” core 3 subject, the “Further Programming” elective, and the “Advanced 
                Programming Techniques” advanced elective, I may also study the “Marketing”, “Economics”, 
                “Internet Design’, or “Management” minors, so that I could potentially manage a development 
                team or market anything I choose to develop by myself, be it software or indie game. OUA offers 
                2 “free elective subjects”, which could be anything from their undergraduate catalogue. So 
                that I can increase my skillset and possible jobs, I currently plan to take a mathematics 
                subject and a graphic design subject. I have also planned to create small indie games during 
                my free time, so my plan to take all programming related courses, possibly take a marketing or 
                economics minor, and to study both mathematics and graphic design would be very helpful for 
                this decision to work to its best. 
                <br><br>
                My plan does not involve when I would be taking each of these courses, as that is subject to 
                very easy change, however, the mathematics free elective is something that should be done 
                before I go through with Further Programming, and the minor I choose may be one of the final 
                subjects I do. Some things will have to be taken in a specific order, such as Advanced 
                Programming Techniques coming last in the programming line and, if I choose to do the Internet 
                Design minor, then Web Programming would be done before that. Either way, I do not have a clear 
                career plan timeline in terms of study but do have a rough draft that I will work to improve 
                upon whenever I can. As for the career itself, my first attempt at a job is likely to be at 
                whatever company hires me from Seek, LinkedIn, or Indeed. On the possibility that online 
                searches and requests do not pan out, then my plan is to use my connections to try and find a 
                job and use the knowledge I’d have learned from this bachelor to accomplish that job. This is 
                the plan for my first job, the second would, hopefully, be considerably easier since I would 
                have spent some time working, gaining experience, and creating connections through my first 
                job, my second job would also be dependent on how my first job’s experience was and if I 
                enjoyed working on development within a team. The 3rd, 4th, and 5th jobs are all going to take 
                what I enjoyed from the last jobs and try to minimise what I did not like or could not work 
                with. This way, I would be learning through trial and error on what I am able to do out of a 
                job in software development and what I am unable to do.

            <h2>Jay Profile</h2>
            <p>
                My name is Jay Meredith, my student number is S3951987. My passions are Game Design, 3D art, 
                and music. I have a Game Design Certificate from JMC Academy, and I also hold a Certificate 
                III in Retail. My favourite hobby aside from the three I have previously mentioned was being 
                the leader of a competitive Counter-Strike team. I backed the idea for the team name ‘iTeam’ 
                because I like the technology theme that is incorporated into the name. 
                <br><br>
                The Myers-Briggs Personality Type Test gave me the INTJ-T personality type. This personality 
                type indicates that my strengths are logical thinking, intuition, and determination. It also 
                indicates that my weaknesses are arrogance, over-criticism, and dismission of emotions. My 
                strengths are going to provide the group with logical problem solving, confidence in decision 
                making, and motivation. My weaknesses are going to need to be kept in check or we may have 
                problems with team chemistry and team morale. 
                <br><br>
                The online learning test indicates that I learn based on primarily logic and, learn well in 
                group environments or in solitude. The test states that my learning weaknesses are physical 
                learning, and sub-par visual learning. My strengths are going to be helpful to our team 
                because my logical, adaptable learning style will be great for both solo study and group study. My weaknesses may cause issues if we must learn physically or visually. 
                <br><br>
                The workstyle test that I chose indicates that my strengths are organising and planning, 
                managing projects, and developing communication strategies. The test also indicates that my 
                weakness is likely to be an overfocus on the administrative side of working as a team. My 
                strengths will help us coordinate as a team but, my weakness may result in me playing catch-up 
                with my teammates. 
                <br><br>
                In conclusion, my strengths will provide the team with a logical thinking decision-maker who 
                will help our team with administrative skills, determination, and an adaptable learning style. 
                My weaknesses, on the other hand, may cause issues with team chemistry, learning through 
                physical or visual mediums, and an overfocus on administrative tasks. With my strengths and 
                weaknesses considered, I believe I will help this team thrive. To help this team thrive, I 
                must remember my weaknesses and be constantly aware of them because once they can be suppressed, 
                I will be a great teammate.

            <h2>Career Plan</h2>
            <p>My ideal job is software engineering because I would love to utilise my creativity and 
                problem-solving skills to create and design software. My ideal job has not changed since 
                assessment 2 because I have thoroughly enjoyed building software for this assessment’s 
                deliverable. Another reason my ideal job has not changed, is the fact that the industry data 
                that I had researched in assessment 2 indicates that software engineering is one of the best 
                careers to aim for in the field of IT.

            <h2>James Profile</h2>
            <p>
                My name is James (s3936965), and I have worked as an IT technician for 
                several years before moving into operations. At present, my hobbies include 
                3D printing and CNC machining. Something I have always enjoyed is gaming mostly 
                on console and mobile. I have a good fundamental understanding of IT hardware, 
                but I have always felt my software understanding could be better. I would love to 
                develop skills that would allow me to produce mobile apps, but I have recently taken 
                an interest in machine learning and AI (Artificial Intelligence). 
                <br><br>
                As a member of iTeam, I am looking forward to sharing my skills and expertise and 
                learning some new ones from fellow team members.  
                <br><br>
                My test outcome for the Myers Brigs personality type was Architect INTJ-A. The architect's 
                personality type is outlined as a quiet individual who values organisation and rationality, 
                these values I align with. Individuals with this personality type can be viewed as ambitious 
                and assertive; however, to work within a small team, I believe it is beneficial to be flexible 
                and play to the entire team's strengths rather than one individual. 
                <br><br>
                My Learning style test outcomes, Auditory: 15% Visual: 55% Tactile: 30%. This test aligns with 
                what I know about myself and how I learn. While my auditory percentile might indicate I am not a 
                good listener, I believe this is more specific to how I can take in new information. I am much 
                better when I can be shown something rather than told. The refinement of these skills comes from 
                hands-on experience of the tactile branch of the above outcomes. 
                <br><br>
                My creativity test score was 68.8, a remarkably arbitrary number assigned at the end of a creativity test. 
                However, within that number were indicated certain aspects of creativity that I was more proficient at, such 
                as complexity or the ability to take in and manipulate large amounts of data. Paradox, the ability to accept 
                and work with contradictory statements and curiosity, is the desire to change or improve things that everyone 
                takes for granted.
