        <h2>Group Profile</h2>

        <p>
            <b>Important Note -</b> Marc had left the team during the final week and had decided to remove all 
            of his content and Daryl has done next to nothing during this entire assessment, only doing around 
            2%. Because of this, we are unable to show their profiles and career goals.
        </p>

        <p>
            We are a dynamic team; all primarily focused on furthering our knowledge within our chosen careers and 
            learning pathways. Our interests align within the software space, all with chosen specialties such as 
            Machine Learning, Game Design or Software Engineering. While each team member holds a unique idea of their 
            path in the IT (Information Technology) industry, most seem to align within the software space or a 
            furthering of their IT career and credentials.
            Our Myers brigs results provide insight into our commonalities that help provide cohesion when we work 
            together. We all remain curious by nature and able to provide input when necessary, playing to the 
            individual's strengths for the whole team's benefit. According to our MB test results, there are multiple 
            leaders within our group. 
            <br><br>
            > Adam - ISTP-T <br>        
            > Daryl - INTJ-A <br>           
            > Jay - INTJ-T <br>           
            > James - INTJ-A <br>          
            > Marc - ISTP-T <br>
            <img src="../Images/Myers_Briggs.png" width="600" height="500" />
            <br><br>
            Knowing more about ourselves has helped us find a place within the team and provides value. We have utilized 
            these results to help us work within the group, each of us finding a way to use our personality strengths to 
            benefit the whole team.
            While there will always be differences between individuals, finding common ground and a meritocratic 
            atmosphere within the group allows all voices to be heard. Understanding ourselves first has allowed us to 
            work better with others; when we are first able to analyse our personality traits, we can take steps to 
            avoid common pitfalls regarding teamwork. Adam has utilized his exceptional technical aptitudes to support 
            less experienced team members, ensuring that the work gets done. Jay has confirmed that the entire team runs 
            on time, providing outstanding organizational skills to put the aces in their places and make sure everyone 
            has a role to play. Daryl and James have found themselves in flexible positions, focusing on stepping up when 
            needed to complete report writing or provide valuable input during team meetings. 
            <br><br>
            Marc has joined our team during the final assessment period but has seamlessly integrated into our group 
            dynamic. Marc shares many of the same interests and passions as the rest of group as well as bringing an 
            exceptional depth of experience to group dynamic having spent many years already in the IT industry including 
            multiple certifications.
            We have all utilized our specific skill sets and strengths to ensure we complete the project. But the central 
            power we have all found is flexibility; working within the team dynamic has required us all to find a way to 
            support the whole team.  
            <br><br>
            Our choice of a major project is an excellent example of our team dynamic; during the first meeting, we 
            quickly moved through our basic framework thanks to some superb planning by Jay and Adam. And when it came 
            to the major project, all participants’ work from assessment one was considered, and each team member took 
            a turn to present their ideas. We discussed the merits and our combined ability to make the project a 
            reality as a team before finally reaching a consensus on Jay’s original submission to make a game. It was 
            quickly apparent that everyone enjoyed Jay’s idea, and we all agreed that we would be capable as a team of 
            being able to bring the concept to life. 
            <br><br>
            We did not take an opportunity to select a leader or create a team structure. Instead, we spent time in open 
            discussion with each team member discussing strengths and weaknesses and then allocating work accordingly. 
            However, this has led to an organic team structure spearheaded by Jay and seconded by Adam. Their leadership 
            has meant we can share and discuss different ideas freely, find cohesion on one idea, and move forward with 
            it is a perfect example of what makes them so strong. 
        </p>

        <h2>Group Process</h2>

        <p>
            During Assignment 2, our team faced some difficulties, as I'm sure most teams will have in one way or 
            another. For us, the problems arose out of accountability and responsibility; At the same time, we had team 
            members who were more than capable of being left to work on their own; it seemed by the end that there was 
            no accountability or feeling of responsibility for at least one team member whom it was discovered had not 
            been working throughout the project on their assigned tasks. This issue is complicated when working on 
            assignments because there should be a common goal that unites the team and ensures that all members work 
            together towards that same goal, mutually assured success. However, what has become apparent with group 
            work within the university environment is that people do not always align under the same purpose. In this 
            situation, it makes group projects a rather unfair environment. When you are left to complete group work 
            with less of a group, it can create problems for the remaining team members who choose to complete the 
            project and make up the work of others. 
            <br><br>
            You can provide feedback and try to get in touch, but when team members stop showing up to meetings, it 
            takes time to come to terms with what it means. Will they arrive on the last day with work in hand, or will 
            they just ghost, never to be seen again? In a workplace, when you don't show up for a week and don't answer 
            a call, your team will move on and replace you as quickly as possible, but within this environment, it is 
            not quite the same. 
            <br><br>
            We had returned to assessment three, understanding some of the pitfalls we faced within our group process 
            from the previous assignment. We had agreed that we would do our best to avoid them with communication, but 
            this did not affect much of a change in the outcome. Some people just don't show up and don't feel any 
            accountability to communicate their needs to ensure that the rest of the team can support them. This can 
            be understood in the real world because it can be challenging in the first instance to communicate at this 
            vulnerable level; no one likes to admit they need help. But it can also be hard to receive it, not everyone 
            is there to help. Despite the open level of communication, we strived to offer to help anyone who needed it. 
            During most meetings, we could not avoid the ghosting of team members. 
            <br><br>
            We effectively identified early on when a team member wasn't showing up and quickly moved to take over those 
            tasks. By doing this, we have avoided the worst of this outcome but have not been able to avoid it altogether. 
            This, however, has only meant that we have not had an absolute struggle towards the end but spread the battle 
            across some of the earlier weeks. It is not an ideal solution, but it has proved to solve the problem, albeit 
            relatively ineffective. 
            <br><br>
            If we were to take on another assessment, I feel it would only be prudent to test out a new strategy, but I 
            can't help but think that the most effective method is to assume the worst from the very beginning. 
            Instituting a backup plan and providing an outline from the outset as to how we would implement it might 
            make some difference to the outcome. This could mean that regardless of meeting attendance, every team 
            member must check in with the team group chat every 2-3 days with a progress report. If we had not heard 
            from a team member for seven days, they would be automatically assumed not to be returning, and we would 
            then implement the backup plan for someone else to take over the workload, but this is just an interaction 
            of what we tried this time. 
        </p>

        <h2>Career Plan Comparison</h2>

        <p>
            Our team has gone through some changes over these two assignments, but this has only solidified our career 
            plans for the most part. Most team members had had a software-focused career goal that, for the most part, 
            would fall under the banner of a software engineer. There have been very few changes to these goals for 
            most team members. If anything, any changes have been made to align into more similar career goals more 
            closely within the software development field. 
            <br><br>
            Some team members have created a very robust vision of how they will achieve this goal, while others seem 
            to wish to take it one step at a time. This seems to closely align with the team members’ personality rather 
            than their ambition or skill level. Adam is a perfect example of this. He seems to understand exactly what 
            his goal is moving forward and how to achieve it, including moving beyond software development skills and 
            into Business and management to make himself more employable. Jay's aspirations of compassion while sharing 
            the same goal seem more concise and focused on achieving each step to move forward to the next one. These 
            dynamics in goal achievement seem to suit the team member's personalities. 
            <br><br>
            James has slightly changed his career goals to align with the rest of the team more closely. His previous 
            goal of being a machine learning engineer began to seem much further away than initially anticipated. While 
            still seeking to achieve this career aspiration of Machine learning engineer, he has realised that software 
            development would be a better first step to reaching this goal. He was able to get to this conclusion by 
            reading through some of the work of the rest of the team and realising that most of his plans were the same 
            as theirs. His approach seems to mirror Jay's approach of one step at a time to reach the goal rather than 
            Adams's grand plan style.

            <h2>Adam Profile</h2>
            <p>
                My name is Adam Saleh, my student number is S3940024. My hobbies include playing video games 
                (Assassin’s Creed, Skyrim, Dragon Ball XenoVerse, Halo, Sonic), watching movies (Expendables, 
                Terminator, Rocky, The Mummy, Spiderman), tv shows (The Flash, Big Bang Theory, Futurama, 
                Simpsons, One Piece), and abridged series (SAO Abridged, DBZ Abridged, Yu-Gi-Oh Abridged). 
                I’ve done pixel art for a few months and started trying out blender (I made a list of hotkeys) 
                because I'm interested in design as a hobby. The IT jobs I'm most interested in are software 
                development and game development. 
                <br><br>
                My interest In IT is mainly in programming, machine learning, robots, and the potential of 
                artificial intelligence, however my skills and experience are very little. I started IT last 
                year with the Cert III in IT with Tafe. After the Cert III, came the Cert IV in Programming 
                which taught someone who couldn’t even display “hello world” C#, SQL, HTML, CSS, and JS . I 
                taught myself a little bit of Python (Py game) and Java (J Frame) before starting this course. 
                <br><br>
                My Myers-Briggs personality is the ISTP-T Turbulent Virtuoso, this personality type is 
                described as rationalized, curious, and creators, they prefer pulling things apart to put 
                them back together, usually better than it was before. They are known as friendly, private, 
                curious, overhasty and practically realistic. An ISTP’s strengths include being optimistic, 
                energetic, creative, practical, spontaneous, rational, prioritisation, composed, and excellent 
                at handling a crisis. Their weaknesses include being stubborn, insensitive, private, easily 
                bored, disliking commitment, and risky behaviour. 
                <br><br>
                The learning style best suited to me is the pragmatist style, a style that learns best from 
                practical, case studies, problem setting, and discussions. A pragmatist is keen to try out 
                ideas/theories to see if they work, search new ideas, and take the first opportunity to test 
                an application. My secondary learning style, of the same score (0.250), is the reflector style, 
                this style learns best with paired discussions, self-analysis questionnaires, demonstrations, 
                feedback, and coaching. The reflector style of learning is more about observing, data gathering
                and analysing than it is the practical approach.  
                <br><br>
                The two workstyle tests I’ve done have indicated that I am an “integrator” and an organised 
                planner. An integrator’s preferred roles are problem-solving and diagnostics with a strong 
                preference for understanding the why of what’s being done. They are known to be self-reliant 
                and prefer the “plan-first” approach. The second of the tests that I’ve done indicates that my 
                preferred way of work is to organize and plan my work, which, as proven by working with this 
                team, is where my strengths lie.  
                <br><br>
                For iTeam, a name I support, I should be able to help organize the work that needs to be done, 
                come up with creative solutions or ideas, prioritise my duties based on time and importance, 
                try out software that is new to me without hesitation, create creative code for the project, 
                and, if need be, I will discuss our course of actions if I do not agree with them. This doesn’t 
                mean I don’t have my weaknesses though, everyone does. As I’ve learnt from the tests I’ve done, 
                and personal experience, my weaknesses within iTeam might just include leaving important but 
                boring tasks until the end, an approach to explanations that lack a practical containing less 
                than ideal memorisations, and getting my tasks done early on and expecting most, if not all, 
                to take a similar approach.

            <h2>Career Plan</h2>
            <p>My ideal job is to become a software developer and create the software that any business or 
                company might need. To become a software developer, I plan to obtain the necessary skills to 
                go above and beyond in this field. My current plan involves taking all programming related 
                courses this bachelor has to offer, such as the “Web Programming” core 1 subject, the 
                “Programming Project” core 3 subject, the “Further Programming” elective, and the “Advanced 
                Programming Techniques” advanced elective, I may also study the “Marketing”, “Economics”, 
                “Internet Design’, or “Management” minors, so that I could potentially manage a development 
                team or market anything I choose to develop by myself, be it software or indie game. OUA offers 
                2 “free elective subjects”, which could be anything from their undergraduate catalogue. So 
                that I can increase my skillset and possible jobs, I currently plan to take a mathematics 
                subject and a graphic design subject. I have also planned to create small indie games during 
                my free time, so my plan to take all programming related courses, possibly take a marketing or 
                economics minor, and to study both mathematics and graphic design would be very helpful for 
                this decision to work to its best. 
                <br><br>
                My plan does not involve when I would be taking each of these courses, as that is subject to 
                very easy change, however, the mathematics free elective is something that should be done 
                before I go through with Further Programming, and the minor I choose may be one of the final 
                subjects I do. Some things will have to be taken in a specific order, such as Advanced 
                Programming Techniques coming last in the programming line and, if I choose to do the Internet 
                Design minor, then Web Programming would be done before that. Either way, I do not have a clear 
                career plan timeline in terms of study but do have a rough draft that I will work to improve 
                upon whenever I can. As for the career itself, my first attempt at a job is likely to be at 
                whatever company hires me from Seek, LinkedIn, or Indeed. On the possibility that online 
                searches and requests do not pan out, then my plan is to use my connections to try and find a 
                job and use the knowledge I’d have learned from this bachelor to accomplish that job. This is 
                the plan for my first job, the second would, hopefully, be considerably easier since I would 
                have spent some time working, gaining experience, and creating connections through my first 
                job, my second job would also be dependent on how my first job’s experience was and if I 
                enjoyed working on development within a team. The 3rd, 4th, and 5th jobs are all going to take 
                what I enjoyed from the last jobs and try to minimise what I did not like or could not work 
                with. This way, I would be learning through trial and error on what I am able to do out of a 
                job in software development and what I am unable to do.

                and music. I have a Game Design Certificate from JMC Academy, and I also hold a Certificate 
                III in Retail. My favourite hobby aside from the three I have previously mentioned was being 
                the leader of a competitive Counter-Strike team. I backed the idea for the team name ‘iTeam’ 
                because I like the technology theme that is incorporated into the name.

                The Myers-Briggs Personality Type Test gave me the INTJ-T personality type. This personality 
                type indicates that my strengths are logical thinking, intuition, and determination. It also 
                indicates that my weaknesses are arrogance, over-criticism, and dismission of emotions. My 
                strengths are going to provide the group with logical problem solving, confidence in decision 
                making, and motivation. My weaknesses are going to need to be kept in check or we may have 
                problems with team chemistry and team morale. 
                <br><br>
                The online learning test indicates that I learn based on primarily logic and, learn well in 
                group environments or in solitude. The test states that my learning weaknesses are physical 
                learning, and sub-par visual learning. My strengths are going to be helpful to our team 
                because my logical, adaptable learning style will be great for both solo study and group study. 
                My weaknesses may cause issues if we must learn physically or visually. 
                <br><br>
                The workstyle test that I chose indicates that my strengths are organising and planning, 
                managing projects, and developing communication strategies. The test also indicates that my 
                weakness is likely to be an overfocus on the administrative side of working as a team. My 
                strengths will help us coordinate as a team but, my weakness may result in me playing catch-up 
                with my teammates. 
                <br><br>
                In conclusion, my strengths will provide the team with a logical thinking decision-maker who 
                will help our team with administrative skills, determination, and an adaptable learning style. 
                My weaknesses, on the other hand, may cause issues with team chemistry, learning through 
                physical or visual mediums, and an overfocus on administrative tasks. With my strengths and 
                weaknesses considered, I believe I will help this team thrive. To help this team thrive, I 
                must remember my weaknesses and be constantly aware of them because once they can be suppressed, 
                I will be a great teammate.

            <h2>Career Plan</h2>
            <p>My ideal job is software engineering because I would love to utilise my creativity and 
                problem-solving skills to create and design software. My ideal job has not changed since 
                assessment 2 because I have thoroughly enjoyed building software for this assessment’s 
                deliverable. Another reason my ideal job has not changed, is the fact that the industry data 
                that I had researched in assessment 2 indicates that software engineering is one of the best 
                careers to aim for in the field of IT.

            <h2>James Profile</h2>
            <p>
                My name is James (s3936965), and I have worked as an IT technician for 
                several years before moving into operations. At present, my hobbies include 
                3D printing and CNC machining. Something I have always enjoyed is gaming mostly 
                on console and mobile. I have a good fundamental understanding of IT hardware, 
                but I have always felt my software understanding could be better. I would love to 
                develop skills that would allow me to produce mobile apps, but I have recently taken 
                an interest in machine learning and AI (Artificial Intelligence). 
                <br><br>
                As a member of iTeam, I am looking forward to sharing my skills and expertise and 
                learning some new ones from fellow team members.  
                <br><br>
                My test outcome for the Myers Brigs personality type was Architect INTJ-A. The architect's 
                personality type is outlined as a quiet individual who values organisation and rationality, 
                these values I align with. Individuals with this personality type can be viewed as ambitious 
                and assertive; however, to work within a small team, I believe it is beneficial to be flexible 
                and play to the entire team's strengths rather than one individual. 
                <br><br>
                My Learning style test outcomes, Auditory: 15% Visual: 55% Tactile: 30%. This test aligns with 
                what I know about myself and how I learn. While my auditory percentile might indicate I am not a 
                good listener, I believe this is more specific to how I can take in new information. I am much 
                better when I can be shown something rather than told. The refinement of these skills comes from 
                hands-on experience of the tactile branch of the above outcomes. 
                <br><br>
                My creativity test score was 68.8, a remarkably arbitrary number assigned at the end of a creativity 
                test. However, within that number were indicated certain aspects of creativity that I was more proficient 
                at, such as complexity or the ability to take in and manipulate large amounts of data. Paradox, the 
                ability to accept and work with contradictory statements and curiosity, is the desire to change or 
                improve things that everyone takes for granted.

                <h2>Career Plan</h2>
                <p>
                    My experience has slightly altered my career plans during this project. When I initially chose 
                    machine learning, I hadn't given it much thought; it sounded good and seemed like an effective way 
                    to get into the field of Artificial intelligence. During this project, I have begun to understand 
                    the scope of machine learning as a career plan. I have decided to set myself a more achievable goal 
                    that keeps me moving towards the goal of becoming a machine learning engineer but provides me with 
                    a solid steppingstone into this field.  
                    <br><br>
                    A software engineer or developer is, in its essence, quite like a machine learning engineer but, in 
                    the short term, is far more achievable. It is important to note that becoming a software engineer 
                    is considered part of the pathway to becoming a machine learning engineer. Should I be able to show 
                    aptitude as a software engineer, it would be a reasonable next step that I could look at, 
                    specialising in machine learning.
