        <h2>Aim</h2>

        <p>
            Our main aim as a group is to produce a fun game; we hope to achieve this through several smaller goals. A 
            fun game is made up of many different components such as narrative, the story the game tells, the mechanics 
            of the game, the way it is played and the technology or how you play it. Creating a fun game means bringing 
            all the above elements together to create a player experience. We want to make a game that provides a 
            thrilling player experience supported by a gripping narrative.
            The narrative aspect of our game is something that all team members consider an essential part of how the 
            player will experience our game. Our goal is to write a story that captures the player, draws them into our 
            game, and lets them invest themselves in the narrative. Creating this connection will help players feel 
            immersed in our designed player experience. The goal of our story so far is to have the player escape their 
            ship infested with aliens; while battling these aliens, players will have to solve puzzles and collect 
            powerups along the journey to help them complete each level. 
            <br><br>
            The game mechanics are based on the narrative and are intentionally left uncomplicated for two main reasons. 
            Firstly, to ensure that we can complete the project on time, and secondly, to provide the primary focus of 
            the player is on the narrative and not on perfectly timing keyboard input, to make a jump for example. Our 
            introductory mechanics will be movement as the player can direct themselves through our created world and 
            shoot as the player destroys aliens inhabiting their ship. We have also included game modes within these 
            mechanics, such as “swarm mode”, an experience where the player is confronted by waves of aliens increasing 
            in difficulty. This mode is less based on the narrative and more on pure mechanics. Several more minor 
            mechanics will also be added to the gameplay experience, such as power-ups which will help players overcome 
            challenges within the game. 
            <br><br>
            The main tools intended for the player will be keyboard input, allowing them to direct their avatar around 
            the environment and engage aliens as they find them. We have selected a computer game because it matches 
            the team's strengths and interest in software and computer gaming. Pygame provides a platform for the team 
            to start building a game using python, a coding language the team has some experience with. It will enable 
            us to create the most immersive experience for the player over other potential options such as a board game 
            or card game. While this environment suites the entire team well in the development phase of the game it 
            would be expected to expand to consoles and potentially mobile devices beyond the initial PC implementation. 
        </p>

        <h2>Plans and Progress</h2>

        <p>
            Our project began with a team discussion; every member was allowed to present their ideas for the main group 
            project. We then, as a team, went through the pros and cons of each project, including our ability to 
            complete the project as a team and what each member liked or did not like about the project. Every team 
            member had a passion for programming and games at their foundation, so when Jay presented his idea of a game 
            that would be designed using Pygame, which is a set of modules that work with the Python programming language, 
            we all unanimously agreed that his project was something we would all enjoy creating and that it would be 
            simple enough to create with our skills. 

            After we decided that this was the project we would move forward with, we began to talk about how we would 
            make it a reality. Jay took the lead in the first discussion giving our team a rundown on his vision and 
            how he saw it becoming a reality; he also outlined any issues or pitfalls he saw with his design and where 
            he felt the team could provide input to improve upon it. Once we had reached a consensus about what our 
            game would look like, we realised we had conceptualised a large project; we all knew we would have to edit 
            it down to something we could manage within the project time frame. So, we began the iteration process. 
            <br><br>
            One of the tools Jay had suggested from the outset was Miro, an online collaboration space that is like a 
            whiteboard where the team could meet and brainstorm ideas for the game. During these brainstorming sessions, 
            we took the opportunity to share ideas and write down anything that came to mind while giving all team 
            members the chance to critique and iterate on the ideas presented. We discussed and brainstormed all 
            components of the game, including visuals, how it might look, the story we were trying to tell, and how we 
            would say to it while providing the player with an unforgettable experience. While we took this opportunity 
            to get all ideas on virtual paper, we knew that the game's scope was increasing again, and we would need to 
            make sure that we stayed in control of the process and focused on producing a final product. 

            We all had enjoyable discussions at this point, filled with discussing the story of our game and sharing 
            thoughts on exactly how we would tell it. Space Shrooms, as we had named it at that point, was designed to 
            play something like a sci-fi psychological thriller. We all loved the idea of a twist ending and thinking 
            about how we would incorporate it into the gameplay. The player would awaken on their ship surrounded by 
            deadly aliens, but unsure how they had come to be in such a dangerous situation. By playing through the 
            levels and story, unlocking doors, solving puzzles, and gaining powerups, the player would become involved 
            in taking back control of their ship to get home. The team discussed bosses being beaten as we played 
            through the game and, more specifically, the final boss where the player would discover that the aliens, 
            they were fighting were their crewmates and they had just been having a bad trip. This would lead to visual 
            changes in the game as the player realises that they were not in their right mind, as they were not battling 
            aliens, but their crewmates and the trail of destruction they had left behind them. During this time, 
            multiple easter eggs or alternate endings were discussed, such as hiding in a room within the game until 
            it was all over and taking an escape pod to evacuate the ship. Both would save the crew and the carnage 
            that would have ensued if the player had stayed. 
            <br><br>
            During this process, we returned to Miro to break down some of our more adventurous ideas and decide 
            precisely what we needed to communicate our player experience and what we would be capable of producing. We 
            used a process where we first looked at foundation ideas, things we could not live without and then our 
            nice-to-haves. The nice-to-haves included things like Easter eggs and multiple of the puzzles we had thought 
            up. While we all agreed we liked these ideas and would consist of them with unlimited time, we knew it would 
            stretch us to finish the project. We decided that things like the puzzles used to open secrets and doors that 
            instead of trying to create three distinct types of puzzles, we could focus on one for our project and ensure 
            we would have as close to a completed product at the end. As for what was necessary, we decided that with the 
            time we had, we should focus less on the story mode and more on the round-based mode we had dubbed Swarm Mode. 
            By the time we had discussed all the things we wanted to include and the things we felt were optional, we were 
            left with something that seemed like we would be able to produce within the allotted period. 

            A week before the end of assessment 2, Jay had organised us into primary and secondary roles for each part 
            of the next assessment. The backend of the game, such as the algorithms, had Jay on primary and Adam on 
            secondary. The frontend, which dealt with things like background spawning and menu switching, had Levian on 
            primary and James on secondary. The game art had Adam on primary and Levian on secondary. The presentation 
            had Daryl on primary with the rest of the team taking the secondary position. The document had James on 
            primary and Daryl on secondary. With these initial roles, we were set to get to work as soon as we could. 
            Soon before assessment 2 had ended, we realised that Levian was an inactive member and started rushing to 
            get their sections of the document done, leaving very little room to begin our assessment 3 roles. We also 
            had to take some time to obtain a new member, this was done relatively quickly and gave the team the 
            addition of Marc Dwyer, someone who took over Levian’s primary role of frontend. Marc had made it clear that 
            he did not have any art related skills, and so we gave him a document role since Daryl’s activity was 
            lessening. By this point, the rest of the team had the secondary role of “feedback” on the game art tasks, 
            since no one else knew how to create using the pixel art style. 
            <br><br>
            Adam began to set up the tools we would use, including PyGame, and how we would all collaborate in building 
            the game code. We ended up using Visual Studio and Visual Studio Code to bring it all together, Visual 
            Studio is being used for its share feature that allowed multiple people to edit the one folder at any time, 
            so long as they have the share link and Visual Studio Code is being used because not everyone on the team 
            was able to use the “community” version of Visual Studio, this is the version that has the share feature 
            included. Adam utilised a meeting to set up both tool with all members ensuring that we had it linked to 
            GitHub and could pull and push our work to the main branch. Adam also used his time to begin work on the 
            game artwork, based on the feedback given by the rest of the team. When he finishes refinement, he presents 
            what he had worked on to the team, taking feedback on colour and other design aspects, then iterating his 
            artwork and presenting the new versions during the next meetings and on the team chat.

            Adam spent much time working with all aspects of the game visuals, including player, map art and animations 
            of various aspects. He supplied all team members with a video tutorial on using PyGame to build a similar 
            style project. He was sure to point out which parts of the video would be helpful to each part of the team. 
            Jay had split us up into frontend and backend teams. The backend takes care of game dynamics such as health 
            and damage, and the front end deals with the map and movement. Having lost a team member from the first 
            assignment, Adam and Jay were quick to onboard a new team member, Mark, who got up to speed quickly and 
            began programming the front end of the game, implementing Adams's artwork to create an on-screen environment.
            Jay and Adam went above and beyond in this section, as can be seen by the number of excellent comments 
            they have left throughout the code, not just adding and editing what was needed, but providing explanation 
            and guidance to those team members who were less experienced. 
            <br><br>
            James, at this point, ran into an issue with his allotted workload mainly due to his job taking up more 
            time that hadn't accounted for, but he was quick to communicate this with the team to ensure as little 
            disruption as possible with the workflow. While not ideal for the overall process, it is understandable 
            that life will get in the way of every project in one way or another, and what was crucial was communication. 
            Letting the team know early meant that everyone was in the loop, and James could pivot into different areas 
            of the project areas without holding up crucial development stages. Daryl has predominantly been assigned 
            to project orientated tasks, but with work commitments much the same as James’, he has not been able to 
            attend meetings as frequently as he would like however, the difference between the 2 was that James had 
            made the effort to communicate his workload issues. 

            Even with these setbacks at this stage, the team remained flexible as Adam and Jay continued working on the 
            code that would get the game to the point where it was up and running. James continued to work on the 
            document that would support our project and its process. The development side of this project required an 
            exceptional level of collaboration, and for much of the team, it was a bit over our heads as we were only 
            at the beginning of our software development journey; however, we were all able to support through the game 
            development process by team members like Adam and Jay who were able to provide support and, where necessary, 
            take over significant sections of the programming to ensure we were able to produce a product that would 
            support our final goal. Despite facing a few issues with collaborating through Visual studio and ensuring 
            that all participating team members were working on the duplicate files, we resolved most of these by using 
            our team meetings to update each other on the correct files that we should be working on. 
            <br><br>
            At this point in time, Jay and Adam worked together on most of the code for our final project. Adam tackled 
            much of the practical format programming on the front-end, and Jay focused on the algorithms that would 
            control player movement and speed. Much thought was given to playability and balancing, for example, how 
            quickly the aliens should move and how much damage they should take from a bullet, all of which are 
            controlled by algorithms written by Jay that give the game its distinct play style. 

            Given the remarkable amount of work being put in by Jay and Adam, James was able to focus on the 
            documentation that would be submitted with our final assessment. At this point, we had not heard from Daryl 
            and began to become concerned that some of the work assigned to him may not be completed in time to be 
            submitted. During a team meeting, James offered to begin preparations to complete the rest of the document 
            work to ensure we would be able to have a complete assessment to submit when the time came. As this work 
            moved ahead, we began to face some issues with another team member, Marc, whose health had impacted his 
            ability to complete some of the assigned work. Unfortunately, this had some significant implications on 
            team morale, and we found ourselves a bit short of content close to the submission date. So, during the 
            next team meeting with our remaining members, Adam, Jay and James, we split up the remainder of the work 
            and decided to move forward with completing the project as planned from the beginning. 
            <br><br>
            The game we have managed to pull together illustrates what we feel our final concept will look like but 
            does not illustrate the level of functionality we would have liked to achieve. What we must show for our 
            work is something playable that we hope explains where we would like to take the project from this point. 
            We have provided an excellent foundation to build upon, probably the most challenging part of developing 
            any game. Some elements like bullet movement, for example, will need refinement for a finished market-ready 
            product to ensure we protect our player experience. Other aspects like the artwork are mostly finished and 
            require slight refinements. All our efforts represent what we intend to see in a finished product. From our 
            current project completion, I would expect that we would have a market-ready effect in approximately four 
            weeks with some extra help from new team members. Without extra help, we would be able to have a market-ready
            products within 6-8 weeks. 

            While our project is in continuous development, we now realise how much work goes into projects like ours. 
            While all involved have worked hard to ensure we have a completed product to hand over, we realise there 
            are multiple things we would have liked to include that did not make the final cut. We aimed to produce a 
            game and managed to achieve something playable in the end, but we all realise that to send a game to market 
            in its current state would be a less than desirable outcome. To complete it, we see the need to add multiple 
            levels and a few more assets to tell our story better and improve overall gameplay.
