        <h2>Roles</h2>

        <h4>Game Art</h4>

        <p>
            All games have some form of game art, whether it's by using pixel art or by creating 3D models. Our game 
            is no exception, and one of our members is skilled enough in pixel art to get us started. Adam will be the 
            primary in the art section because he is the only member with prior experience with this section of game 
            development. Jay has no experience with pixel art, some with 3d modelling, but none with pixel art, he can 
            however, critique work very well, this gives it a much higher standard to live up to and due to this he’s 
            the secondary on the game art section, giving Adam reviews and feedback to the art he completes to produce 
            the best work possible in our time frame. This primary role is ideal for Adam because he has experience in 
            using pixel art, and it would take some time for the other members to learn how to use this form of art, 
            possibly too much time for this project. Jay’s secondary role is ideal for him because of his critiquing 
            skills mentioned above, these skills have come in handy in ensuring that the art we work with for the game 
            ends up enhancing the experience of playing a retro-styled game. 
        </p>

        <h4>Backend</h4>

        <p>
            This section of game development requires the developers to use a coding language, in our case Python, to 
            develop the parts of the game the player will not get to interact with, these include room item placements, 
            such as walls, doors, and floors, enemy movement, such as moving left and using a specific designed 
            animation, and screen changes, from the menu to the game over screen. Jay will spearhead this section 
            because of his interest in the subject and because it allows him to learn more about the Python programming 
            language, even if he is mainly using the module set: Pygame. Adam will take on a secondary role in the 
            backend, refining the code that Jay works on and ensuring that it takes up as little lines as possible 
            while still working to its best standard. This secondary role is ideal for Adam as he has used pygame before 
            to create a small game and has completed a Cert IV in Programming, so is best able to critique the code, 
            adjust and refine it, and leave well detailed comments on why he has done what he has. 
        </p>

        <h4>Frontend</h4>

        <p>
            The role of front end is primarily what the user is able to look at and interact with, for a video game 
            this role is very likely to tackle in-game items like power-ups and door openings, text screens, such as 
            the ones used to tell the story in 2d games both in the past and nowadays, and player interaction, like the 
            key card puzzle we are planning to implement. Due to team changes and the timeframe, our newest member, 
            Marc, will be coding the front-end, like a front-end wizard, a title he is already living up to. Adam will 
            be the secondary in this section as well, this is due to the two reasons stated in the “Back End” role, he 
            has used pygame before and has the most experience coding, and as such is able to give the best feedback and 
            refinements on the work done than the rest of the team. Marc’s availability and willingness to learn a 
            module he has never heard of before is what makes him ideal for the job, he has coded all the front side of 
            the game, barring the refinement Adam has made, after taking a good look at one or two tutorials, only. 
            Adam, like before, is secondary for the reasons stated above and is willing to review the code the night of 
            every change to ensure that it both works to its best, and that it takes up as little lines as possible. 
        </p>

        <h4>Presentation</h4>

        <p>
            Presenting a project is just as important as creating it, if one does not show-off how good their game is 
            only the very, very few would be willing to give it a shot, at best when they’ve reached the limits of 
            their boredom. To present our video game, Solus Miles, we have decided to give it a gameplay trailer 
            containing the focus of our project, the Swarm Mode, as well as movements, gun types, alien types, and 
            power-up usages. Before we started planning, we had a look at the video game trailers of Halo Infinite, 
            Minecraft, Titanfall, Undertale, and Stardew Valley, this has helped us understand what people are looking 
            for in trailers and have given us ideas on what to utilise for our project, with features such as music, 
            timing, and foreshadowing. This section, being as large as it is, has no secondary roles as everyone will 
            have something to do in the section. Jay and Adam have worked on the basic idea of the trailer, and are 
            going to capture some gameplay footage to use, James and Daryl will be using those captures to create a 
            trailer that works with the concepts of the original idea, and Marc will be helping us on both sides of 
            this section, capturing footage to use and then helping the edit of that footage to make sure the basic 
            ideas, at the very least, are there. These jobs are ideal for every member of the team, this is due to how 
            important presentation is in this industry, whether you are presenting a video game or applying for a job, 
            there will be no lack of necessity in being able to present something to someone, and this skill is what we 
            all hope to learn by taking part in the presentation section of the project. 
        </p>

        <h4>Document</h4>

        <p>
            The document is a section that cannot be the primary focus of this assessment, unlike the previous one, 
            as we have tasked ourselves with creating a small round-based video game with the timeframe we have 
            available. In fact, to get everything done to an amazing standard would take a miracle and a couple boxes 
            of red bull, each. This’ll never stop us from trying however, not in obtaining the red bull, but in working 
            on the project’s document, as we will do the best that we can with the timeframe that we do have. Daryl and 
            James have both been very busy with work this time ‘round, and as such have no time to get onto their 
            personal computers (or laptops or tablets) and work on the code with Marc, Jay, and Adam, they do have the 
            time to access and work on the document with their time, making them the perfect candidates to complete all 
            the information within a great enough schedule. The other three members are on a secondary role however, as 
            they must review and refine the work that the two will accomplish so that our work can still be as best as 
            it can be. James and Daryl are ideal for the role of document work because of their strict timeframes, and 
            due to these timeframes, they are unable to spend a lot of time focusing on learning a new set of modules, 
            or in Daryl’s case, a whole new language and its modules. Since everyone else has some form of skill in 
            Python and have the time to learn the Pygame modules, they are perfect for the code related roles of back 
            and front, however, this does not mean they get a pass on document work, as everyone is required to review 
            the work that Daryl and James will have accomplished and add in the notes that they feel are important. 
        </p>

        <h2>Scope and Limits</h2>

        <h4>What will be cut</h4>

        <p>
            Taking our timeframe into consideration, we cannot implement all the features that we would like to. These 
            features include the story, the equipment, and the key cards. We will not be able to implement the story 
            into the game because we must have quality features, rather than a larger quantity of features. Developing 
            the story within our time constraints would force us to violate the rule of quality over quantity because 
            we would need to have at least one person devoted to the story over any other components. We will not be 
            developing the equipment in the game because it would require us to balance more features of the game, and 
            the equipment system is too much like the power-up system to have any drastic effects on the impact of our 
            game. If we were to implement the equipment idea into the game, it would slow down the development process 
            by a distinguishable amount, and the effort that it would take would not be worth our time. The key cards 
            will not be a feature within the game because they are only featured within the story mode, and since we 
            are not going to be doing the story mode, there is no reason to include them. Furthermore, the key cards
            are non-essential to the game even if we were to create the story mode, and they may hinder the player, 
            more than they increase their experience. You may ask, if you are not going to include the story mode, what 
            are you going to include? 
        </p>

        <h4>Swarm Mode</h4>

        <p>
            The swarm mode will be the key to developing our project with scope and limitations in mind. The swarm mode 
            will cater to our limitations because it reduces the time developing game art, clears the time needed to 
            create the story, and it makes the implementation of key cards obsolete. It reduces the time consumption of 
            developing game art because the swarm mode takes place in a single room whereas the story mode, includes 
            multiple rooms. It clears the time needed to create the story because the swarm mode is a round-based mode 
            which has no story included. The key cards are non-essential for the swarm mode because they are tied to 
            the use of multiple rooms, and the story, which as I have stated previously, are non-essential. These 
            factors make the key cards a perfect candidate for removal, and each of these features being easily removed 
            by making our only mode the swarm mode proves that the swarm mode is the best option for this project. 
        </p>

        <h4>Weapons and Power-Ups</h4>

        <p>
            The weapons will also be included within our product because they cater to our scope and limits, and they 
            are essential to our project. The variation in weapons may not be essential to proving our concept, but 
            they are easily included due to them being like one another. The adjustment that we will make to cater to 
            our scope and limitations will be removing the shotgun’s bullet spread because it is an unnecessary unique 
            ability. The weapons we will be including will not include any melee weapons but will include the pistol, 
            the shotgun, the sub-machine gun, and the rifle. 
            <br><br>
            We will also include power-ups because they are essential to proving the concept of the game. We can include 
            various power-ups because they all fall under the same class and provide abilities to our players without 
            the need for an exponential amount of time. Having said that, we will only be including three power-ups due 
            to the scope and limits of this project. The specific power-ups we will be including will be double damage, 
            adrenaline, and pest control. Double damage and adrenaline both provide the user with boosts to their stats, 
            therefore, they are easily implemented. Pest control, on the other hand, will clear out aliens from the 
            level. This may be more difficult to implement than the other two, but it will be essential for helping the 
            player survive longer during their swarm mode experience, and it will provide a greater proof of concept to 
            the project. 
        </p>

        <h4>Aliens</h4>

        <p>
            Another feature we will be including within our project is the variety of aliens. We need to have various 
            aliens each with unique traits in their combat styles because we need to prove the concept of ever adapting 
            combat. Given our time constraints, we will have to compromise on the archetypes of fighting styles, so we 
            will be including the two main archetypes within our project, the offensive and defensive archetypes. The 
            offensive aliens we will be including will be the bomber, the sniper, and the mosquito. The defensive aliens 
            we will be including are the shield, the turret, and the armoured wing. We need to include all six of these 
            aliens because they each provide a unique threat to the player, therefore, enhancing the proof of concept. 
        </p>

        <h4>Difficulty</h4>

        <p>
            We must also include the various difficulties into the game because they are one of the greatest features 
            of the game for challenge fans which is one of our primary archetypes to focus on. The difficulty levels 
            are within the scope and limitations of the project because they are straightforward, because they decrease 
            and increase certain statistics which makes them easy to implement. We will be cutting the extreme 
            difficulty level from the project under the condition that we are running out of time, but I believe that 
            with the scope and limitations of this project we will be able to produce an excellent product which will 
            prove our concept with its marvellous execution. 
        </p>

        <h2>Tools and Tech</h2>

        <p>
            The project we are creating is a video game with a simple plot, sort of, with even simpler hardware and 
            software requirements. To make this game work on a computer, the user is only required to own at least 
            a Windows 10 computer, a staple nowadays, with a working keyboard, and possibly a mouse, depending on the 
            controls we will choose to incorporate. We may also consider making it work on Mac and Linux computers, 
            if they require some form of difference, but it will depend on our timeframe. We will be using the Visual 
            Studio desktop application, an IDE that any RMIT student is able to download. We will also be using its 
            share feature to work within one coding folder, this will allow us to not have to copy and paste any major 
            changes across game repositories. Another tool we will use on the software side is Aseprite, which is an 
            application for creating pixel art, a skill that one of our members knows well enough to incorporate it 
            into the project. There are free art editors available online that any other member can use, such as Piskel, 
            the art editor that Adam was using before he moved to Aseprite. Other than these, a video editor will have 
            to be used to create our presentation, a game trailer. Currently, it is known that Jay has Adobe Premiere 
            and Adobe After effects, two applications that can be used to edit videos. Their features include, but are 
            not limited to, transitions, LUTs (filters), and visual effects. Both applications can be utilised by any 
            RMIT student, so the rest of us will have to install them and learn how to use them through Jay. With 
            these applications we will be able to create a fun game with a compelling trailer.
